## Exhibition Title:

Marais: The Trendy Marsh
Architecture in Paris's Le Marais District

## Goal:

Le Marais is a historical district in Paris that was originally a marsh 'marais' in french. It has transformed to be one the the most beautiful nieghbourhoods in Paris. Having persoanlly stayed there on several occasions, my exhibition curates images of architecture across time. I wanted visitors to look back at the roots of development and contrast their experiences now with what they would've experienced then and rethink the identity of the neighbourhood. 

Challenges:
Reading about the interactive exhibitions in the last couple of classes I would've also liked my curation to encourage dialogue. For this I would like to create a panel where people could write about their memories from each landmark of the area.
Omeka was challenging to use, with regards to individually uploading and matching the information.
