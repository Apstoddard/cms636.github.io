#Project Title
Rise of YouTube

##Problem Statement 
Analyzing interactions of YouTubers and how they growed to gain their first 1 million followers.   
##Approach
This class has been focused heavily on timelines and visulaizing things over time, so I thought it'd be cool to analyize the top 10 or so YouTube videos before their first million followers and see who they interacted with before hand. 
##Audience
YouTubers and people interested in becoming YouTubers
##Skills Meeded
Minor coding skills needed to make timeline
