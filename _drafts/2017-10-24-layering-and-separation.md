Key points are made about surplus visual activity, the interaction between visual elements often creates this non-informational noise and clutter. Furthermore, discusses certain changes that can be made to reduce this, such as placement of text with visuals and using textures that separate layers to create a more soothing visual effect, as well as eliminating unnecessary design elements. 

I found it really interesting that small details like these can drastically affect our perception of the data being represented. And how this idea can be misused to dramatacize or emphasize the wrong data, or distract from the fact with subjective projections by the creators of these visualizations.
