I thought the ideas about sound and sonification were really interesting, and the reading reminded me of a couple of things. A while ago, I read about scientists/musicians taking raditation data from space and converting it into "music of the galaxy", so to speak. I remember that it was kind of interesting as a concept, but the "music" wasn't really much like music as it was sustained electronic tones, but I suppose I wasn't expecting Mozart. Regardless, it was sort of surreal to "hear" outer space. I can't find the video for the music, but I did find something similar conducted by [NASA to help them understand black holes](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/universe/black_hole_sound.html). I think that it is easy to imagine work that people would create in a visual medium, for example, photographs of outer space are often highly processed and colors are added by computers â€” but for some reason these are somewhat more comprehensible than audio analogs. I'd be interested in seeing (or I suppose, hearing) more examples of not-so-intuitive representations of sound. I do agree that scholars sometimes have difficulty imaging a media form moving beyond traditional boundaries and forms. I also agree that we can certainly pick up more streams of information with hearing than we can with our vision, for the exact reasons of focus the author mentions. However, when consciously analyzing data, I certainly feel more comfortable with and trust more, visual data. I think it is easier to pick up on anomalies in the things the article mentions, such as heartbeat, radiation detectors, and off key music, but I'm not sure I trust myself to detect meaningful patterns in things like the galaxy music, but perhaps we just need a bit more exposure and practice.
