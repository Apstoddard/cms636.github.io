Part of the "Colour and Inforamtion" apply to all visualization and had htreads in common with potographyand videoography. For example the eye will be dran to the lightest object in a frame, the brightest colour and sharp obects over blury objects. In this way some of the principle he discusses in mapping are similar to the wasy artists manipulate the eye in a painting or photographers manipulate the eye in a photograph. Poorly done the eye is drawn to the wrong objectn the phot or not=ne at all. It was interesting to think of the way colour theory can aid or fail the process of displaying information. I think prior I only though of colour on maps as either pleasing or not pleasing. Not a "missing the point" or distracting from information. 

I think there is a similar thread in the design piece, but while colour is an *almost* universal problem. ( except for the nuanced differences we see or emote in colour) with design audience skill at interpresting the design also matters.In the mapping of the moons from Galleleo's simple and accessible recording to the modern one which has much more detail, but requires skill to "read." When visual represetations work they are faster to understand than texts, the tension is in displaying information meaningfully. Some of the examples here remind me of the earlier reading wherethey become complicated to decode and more "art than information" in Will's words.
