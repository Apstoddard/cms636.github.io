I appreciate the recognition that an interface alone can't be a teaching tool -- I think that's too much to expect from a technical solution, and a failure to see that results in a lot of the missteps and overreaches we see in ambitious technology applications. I'm curious how they meet their goal of somehow representing all objects in a collection on a single landing page for the datasets described -- hundreds of thousands of objects is a lot! I also wonder whether the dynamics of trust and aesthetics have changed since this was written, as in the past couple of years users have become very savvy and also very cynical. Can someting be TOO polished to be seen as trustworthy?
