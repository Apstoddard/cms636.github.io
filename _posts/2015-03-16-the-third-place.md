The IMLS report outlines the a number of great goals for museums and libraries, but one that stood out to me as particularly impactful, and ambitious, is making a museum or library a “third place”. This mission struck a chord with me because the library and museum certainly served as a “third place” in my small town.

Students in my elementary school often found ourselves at the library after school to either read, participate in a fun activity, or simply to use a computer. Furthermore, as the second largest building in the center of town (second only to the church), the library hosted a number of family oriented events. The library recognized its importance in the community and used it to encourage children to read more - holding reading competitions and storytimes.

The armory museum, which housed hundreds of pieces of arms and armor, served a similar role. As one of the few museums very close by, most children at my town would hold their birthday parties there, and families would visit often (usually bringing visiting relatives or friends). Despite their limited funding, the armory museum made great efforts to hold shows and events to educate and entertain their visitors. Unfortunately, it was closed two years ago.

In a large suburb or a city, it can be difficult for a library or museum to be the “third place”. However, in small towns such as mine, libraries and museums are uniquely positioned not only to popularize reading and history among citizens, but also to serve as a community hub.
