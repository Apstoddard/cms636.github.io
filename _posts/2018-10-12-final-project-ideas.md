thinking of focusing mainly on AR media, also linking physical + digital stuff

primary idea: an AR app that lets you write stories in 3d space, letting you walk through/around them. also thinking about creating physical data visualiations from literature, e.g. 3d printing instead of just working with web based visualizations.

skills needed: 3d modelling, parametric / generative design, fiction writing, special effects and film making
