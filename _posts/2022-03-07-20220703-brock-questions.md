## Questions for David Brock
  
  David Brock has such an interesting perspective on the world. 
  - How do you see audio/text translation in AI being applied broadly to museums? How would this be different from, for example, audio guides that are offered in the same languages?
  - This technology has obvious applications to museums (especially with translating and categorizing). Do you think that museum-centric AI will become a large focus or will it be cast by the wayside as a passing trend? On both the museum end and research end.
  - You discuss how the website can search through metadata of images or audio that was created by AI. How do you adjust the metadata in these searches for biased machine learning algorithms? Do these systematic inaccuracies impact exhibits within the museum?
