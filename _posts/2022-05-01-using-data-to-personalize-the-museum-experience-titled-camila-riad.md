title: Using data to personalize the museum experience titled - Camila & Riad

Our project aims to create a personalized museum journey experience for users based on their preferences. We augment an existing platform with a circular customer journey that starts with a small survey to begin curating preferences, followed by automated location based check-in and museum-specific recommendations and finally a centralized membership sign-up form. Our platform of choice is Google Arts & Culture which currently harbors a large database of museums, artists and exhibitions; however, it is missing a personalized aspect. We aim to showcase how personalization can enhance the museum experience all the while providing new avenues for business growth for museums including, membership sales and gift shop recommendations.
