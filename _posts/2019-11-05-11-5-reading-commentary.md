I appreciate that both readings, but especially Printing Walkable Visualizations, were routed in such concrete examples. In doing so, I felt they provided more useful context about these usage of such changes that I feel we often haven't seen in previous readings in this class. Many of the readings we have done for this class have focused on identifying limitations opportunities of improvement for certain visulizations, but then don't offer an alterative, or those that are offered don't seems nearly as practical. By contrast, Rodighiero took the time to explain why different choices were made, as also highlighted considerations such as the choice of materials to make a walkable network and the difference in price to install them. I found it much easier to wrap my mind around the concepts proposed than other more asbtract examples.
