## ICA reflection

The Simone Leigh exhibition at the ICA is a truly captivating experience, showcasing the artist's unique style and dedication to advocating for black women. Leigh's distinctive approach, merging objects like vessels and clay pots with female forms, creates a powerful visual impact.

What sets the ICA exhibition apart from others is its thoughtful use of space and innovative presentation methods to enhance visitor experiences. The arrangement of the sculptures, facing different directions, coupled with the carefully selected soundscape and lighting, creates an immersive environment that invites visitors to fully engage with the artist's works. The ICA integrates interactive displays and multimedia installations to enrich visitor experience, also through the use of questions in makerspace and also in artwork descriptions. 

ICA's emphasis on creating a memorable, open atmosphere has been a consistent feature across its exhibitions. The museum is known for incorporating elements like large windows offering ocean views and seagulls, which contribute to a more expansive and liberating experience. In contrast to some museums that may feel restrictive, ICA fosters a sense of freedom and spaciousness for its visitors, making their time spent within the museum truly enjoyable and memorable.
