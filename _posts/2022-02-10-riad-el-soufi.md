## Enhanced Critical Curation 

In this reading, curation is referred to as an act of creating value, impact and quality. This resonated quite well especially in the context of the class conversations when talking about the creation of knowledge around an object. This perspective can clearly help us differentiate between the collector vs. musuem owner. The realm of digital humanities presents additional challenges as the proliferation of objects becomes more and more accessible; curation becomes more difficult. Interested to hear the MiT Musuem curatorâ€™s perspective and how they have adopted their practices to keep up with these innovations.
