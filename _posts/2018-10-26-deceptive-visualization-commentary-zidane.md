title: Deceptive Visualization Commentary - Zidane

## A New Post

I’d like to start by saying I appreciate this study and the immense amount of effort that went into maintaining the validity of the study methodologies, unlike that of the chart junk study.  Such decisions, such as not considering differences between intentional and unintentional deceptiveness - only the effects, as inexperience can lead to deception as well, categorizing the different types of deceptiveness (Message exaggeration and reversal, as well as the methods for each), as well as taking the education of the participants into account. Also small things, like adding an attention question to filter out random clickers (that actually worked!) are great methods to ensure quality and validity of responses.


I think the article does a great job of showing the motivations for people/organizations to use deceptive visualization techniques (i.e. in a rush to convince people, or a sneaky technique to trick people by rotten firms). I also believe that the end goal of the study, education of the public and dialogue creation on the topic of deceptive visualizations, is very socially relevant, especially today in the age of “fake news”, and has very positive and admirable motivations.

After reaching the conclusion, I was alarmed. I did not think there would be almost 80% of people decieved by these deceptive techniques. That number is surprisingly high, especially since the actual data was shown alongside the graphs in each case, although this is very easy to say after being educated on the different types and being on the lookout for them. I wonder what my score would be if I was one of these participators. What would my MIT colleagues’ scores be? I think that it’s also interesting that education did not have as great of an effect on ability to discern deceptive charts as I thought it would. I also think they have a good next step in order to further knowledge (determining whether type of distortion or type of chart has greater weight in deception).
