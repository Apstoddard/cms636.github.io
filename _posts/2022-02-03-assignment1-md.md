# Comment on _2040: Hello and Welcome to the Future” by Adam Rozan, American Alliance of Museums, Museum, Magazine 2040, November/December, 2017._

In this text, the museum of the coming years is presented as a manifestation of the individual and societal expectations of a population of the XXI century, going beyond the simple cultural framework. It is a vision where the initial function of the museum is no longer successfully fulfilled or deemed worthy of interest for a global population, (because monopolized by an elitist sub-population): "museums moved away from a scholarly focus to a community one, from academic to popular, from selective to inclusive, we rebuilt our staffing strategies around ways to engage our communities". The latter has the ambition to achieve a much more complex task: to bring together, mobilize and educate and to give meaning to its entire community through a hybrid and malleable identity (but also "change the world"). It is therefore a matter of extending the value offer in a consecutive way in order to adapt it to different expectations:

* Social needs
    * To strengthen the ties within the community, the knowledge of its local history, through meetings, frequent exchanges, activities.
* Psychological and spiritual needs: "> social workers and counselors, therapists and psychologists, artists and musicians, engineers and web developers. We hired storytellers and clergy" 
    * Through psychological support: In order to respond to potential individual distress, via the presence of therapists and psychologists. 
    * Through religion: Bringing the community together through shared beliefs, place of worship, place of reflection and display of traditions. 
    * Through art: Here we find the original vocation of the museum but as a sub-part of a more global mission. The local and specific component for the community of the works must be paramount, the art can even be created within it. 
* Material needs and education
    * Through continuous education, thanks to professionals and the help of its community, in order to stay up to date with the demands of the world of work.
    * Reversal of the role of the curator: The curator no longer offers an experience to the visitors (through "> collecting, organizing, and presenting") but allows the visitors to create their own experience, by giving them access to content and tools. 


Two aspects of technology: a contribution vector of radical change via digital (digitization, digital fabrication, and virtual and augmented reality). But mainly, technology as an incremental tool to respond in a more relevant way to existing problems instead of creating new possibilities. 
Several personal impressions after reading the text:

* It would seem that the author advocates a transition from the concept of a museum to that of a community center. Knowing how difficult it is to achieve the latter in a permanent, efficient and local way, I find it hard to believe that this is a viable solution in general. And this as much on the financial level as on the level of visitor attraction and positioning in society. If this transition is motivated by a difficulty to achieve the original task, the chances of success with the new task seem low. 
* The word community is present 27 times, where art is present only 7 times. This concept seems to take precedence in the American context over the more European notion of society. One of the central roles of the museum in my opinion is to place the visitor in a larger context through art, science or history. By nature, this context goes beyond the simple framework of the community in favor of society or humanity more generally. It therefore seems to me incomplete to try at all costs to make it relevant on a more local scale and to evaluate it only in terms of this criterion.
* In my opinion, the role of the museum, thanks to the curator, is also to expose to truths that we would not have had access to otherwise, with the aim of educating or raising awareness. In a world where information is becoming more and more abundant, biased and complex, the need for this task becomes all the more important. To remove the latter, even if it is with the aim of empowering the individual seems strange to me. On the contrary, we must be aware that its role is all the more important and difficult.  
* A distinction must surely be made between museums of considerable size in large cities and those more modest and local. The objectives, the financial means, the access to different audiences or collections of art differ greatly.

# Comment on _At the Foot of the Hill_

Three overlapping points stand out to me:
* The fact that technology was a necessity here in order to carry out the project because of the degradation of the site is a coincidence that I find pleasing. Instead of forcing its use, it appears as a necessary and natural solution. In an environment where we often tend to do too much to be innovative and attract attention, it is good to show such successes.
* I particularly enjoy the fact that such demonstration of cutting edge technology was used in the context of a prehistoric site.  It shows that technology can serve to recreate, support or enhance many types of experiences. 
* Finally, I was greatly impressed by the collaborative aspect of the project. I didn't know that such a large number of actors was necessary to carry out such a project. Beyond the number, the fact to see paleontology experts collaborating with scenarists, architects or engineering experts is surely far from easy. These worlds rarely have to communicate and managing to guide them with a common goal is surely far from smooth. It would seem almost appropriate to mention this challenge in the experience offered to the museum visitor.
