### Final project idea: Crowd-sourced location-aware digital curation to augment space

We're interested in answering the question: How do different people view and feel about the same space? Our idea for our final project involves creating an application for the Google Cardboard. Based on GPS location, the user can put on the Cardboard and view posts curated from others at that same location, such as Instagram photos and Twitter tweets. As an additional layer, we would also include the emotion expressed in each tweet, using sentiment analysis. Our hope is that this application could have a multitude of uses, ranging from more scholarly uses such as at historical sites and museums, to more casual uses. This would allow us to gain insight into the experiences and perspectives of the people around us.
