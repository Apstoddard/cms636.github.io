<i>I didn't actually have a chance to go to any of the museums listed this past week since I was out of town from Mar. 18 to Mar.29. My schedule also doesn't allow me to go any time this week before the class. I figured the best alternative I have is to do this assignment on a place I'm very familiar with. Although I've been to the MFA, Musuem of Science, Harvard Museum of Natural History, and Boston Children's Museum more than once, I have been to the New England Aquarium 5 times in the past five years. I think I've seen almost every corner of the aquarium including the the 4D theater. Therefore, I believe it is fair to complete this assignment without going there again.</i>

##Demographics:
The aquarium attracts many families especially family with young kids and K-12 school field trips. Though the aquarium also offers private event hosting - for example, MIT 2015 class council had two events there in the past. The aquarium offers a fun and relaxing experience while providing educational values at the same time. These qualities make it very attractive to parents and educators.

##Technology:
The aquarium has a small board that introduces the species next to each tank. However, larger tanks might have multiple boards nearby. While the boards include small pictures of the animals, it is often hard to identify the small fish based on that. Visitors often skim the text and not actually read them because they are often long and not interesting to the kids. The lighting is also very dim in the aquarium to protect the fish which makes is hard to read things. Making these boards more visible and easier to read (maybe with more graphics) might encourage people to use it more.

Most of the current boards are not interactive. However, there is a few interactive displays in the aquarium. One example is the sound examples at the penguin section. There are multiple interfaces that allow visitors to press buttons and play the sounds of the different penguins. I personally loved pressing them I was there but I didn't see very many people using it. I think one of the reasons why people don't use them is because they are not aware of them. Younger kids who might benefit more from this feature often can't see or understand this. Making it more intuitive to younger kids will make is more useful.

##Unexpected/Unintended Uses:
There are very few misuses of technologies at the aquarium since there isn't anything complicated to use. 

##Frustrations:
One of the biggest issues I experienced during my visits is the visibility inside the aquarium. It is understandable that the lighting needs to be dim for the health of the animals. However, the dim lighting makes it very hard to locate friends or family members if the party is separated. Technology could definitely help here. If each visitor is given a bracelet with a tracker inside and is able to activate tracking of each desired tracker on their smart phones, it will be much easier for parents to find their children or for friends to find each other during the visit.

##Interior/Exterior:
The exterior of the aquarium is very modern and cool looking which can attract people to visit.
