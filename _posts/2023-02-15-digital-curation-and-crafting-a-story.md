With the internet containing seemingly infinite amounts of information, anyone with internet access can learn about anything. However, internet browsing and clicking through random websites to learn about a topic isn’t really meaningful unless one is able to string bits and pieces of information together as one cohesive story. Yet, this isn’t as easy as it seems, simply because there is so much information out there, and there are so many stories to tell, and there are even numerous perspectives on just one story. 

One quote stood out to me: “To curate is to filter, organize, craft,and ultimately, care for a story composed out of - even rescued from - the infinite array of potential tales, relics, and voices” (34). In a digital sphere and in a digitized society, the work of the curator goes beyond just finding artifacts and information, as anyone can do that, but crafting a story that people care about from them.
