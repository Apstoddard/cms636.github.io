## Do we Agree on What A Database is?

This paper may just be old, but I think the author is underinformed as to what a database empirically is. For example, I would not consider a DVD to be a database, but Lev goes on classifying nearly every single modern digital medium as a database. CD-ROM's, cassettes, videotapes, and even HTML web pages get swept under the "database" rug. I suppose that a database, by definition, is just an organized collection of data, but that's different from a presentable collection of data. I think what makes a collection of data a true database is rigid formatting and quick retrieval of specific information which is only possible because of the rigid layout.

Take, for example, a web page. _Is there data_? Yes. _Is it a collection of data?_ Yes. _Is it organized?_ Well, in the sense that entropy has been locally reduced, yes. _Is it formally organized such that specific information can be retrieved efficiently?_ Absolutely not. So a web page is almost a database but it lacks defined structure. A web page designer is free to put any data anywhere on the page, so it doesn't have to be organized. I think that makes a web page such a horrible database that it shouldn't even be considered one.

The reason for this database confusion is that the definition of a database, ironically, is underspecified! Honestly, right after I finished the paper I quickly went to Wikipedia to find a more updated definition but, lo and behold, I wound up with the same one referenced in the paper. This makes me uneasy because, as a computer scientist, my canonical definition of a database isn't quite the same as the formal definition. I don't think anyone is wrong, just that the definition needs to be revised or generalized to point towards sub-definitions.
