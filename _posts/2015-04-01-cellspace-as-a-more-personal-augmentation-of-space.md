The Sakip Sabanci Museum's integration of mobile app technologies was extrememly powerful in adding new dimensions to the otherwise two-dimensional art of calligraphy, particularly in its limited form in books. Reevaluating this experience within the context of Manovich's definition of a "cellspace" made me realize that I prefered this form of less invasive augmentation of space. Unlike the in-your-face visual/digital display augmentations, cellspace augmentations allow a more "transparent", or optional conveyance of information. In the case of the sabanci museum, the mobile app augmentation allowed access to additional, digitally encoded data that visitors had the option of exploring. However, for the less interested visitor, the physical displays of single pages of calligraphy books were enough to give a broad understanding of the presented information.

However, cellspace augmentations in the form of cellphones or tablets still lack the capabilities of making the experience immersive. As Manovich also stresses, a key method of making a spatial augmentation immersive is simply by making it or projecting it bigger. This is why I think the Google Glass would provide a good way to fix this limitation. The personal nature of glass is perfect for presenting users with the option of augmentation rather than forcing them to experience it. However it also allows full immersion and a much more enriched AR experience. Basically I see good potential in Glass for replacing the outdated audioguide headsets (and pretty much only that).
