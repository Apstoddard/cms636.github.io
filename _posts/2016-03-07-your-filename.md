Hi! I'm Karrie Peterson, a librarian at Hayden Library.  I've been at MIT about one year.  My job is about providing support for research and teaching, especially emerging new kinds of scholarship.  That's why I'm in the DH class, and it's giving me plenty of ideas where the Library could be better engaged.  Please feel free to share any of your thoughts about Library support for your classes with me, including this DH class.
