[peterson.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/peterson.jpg)Hi! I'm Karrie Peterson, a librarian at Hayden Library.  I've been at MIT about one year.  My job is about providing support for research and teaching, especially emerging new kinds of scholarship.  That's why I'm in the DH class, and it's giving me plenty of ideas where the Library could be better engaged.  Please feel free to share any of your thoughts about Library support for your classes with me, including this DH class.  I have a hard time imagining what else you might want to know about old people who were your age in the 60s and 70s, it was a radical and groovy time and I do miss a lot about those days. But life at MIT is enthralling, and it's the closest I've come since to being "where it's at."  Right on!
