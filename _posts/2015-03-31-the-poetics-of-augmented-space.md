Whenever I hear augmented reality, my mind automatically jumps to Google glass type of interaction. And when I hear visual reality, I immediately think of Oculus Rift. It is interesting to consider cellphones an augmentation of the reality as I have always seen it as part of the most basic parts of life. I think the article made a fair point of that. However, Manovich claimed that "whether we think of a particular situation as immersion or augmentation is simply a matter of scale". I couldn't but wonder if the differentiation should be how the users interact with the technology. TV and movie theaters provide rather passive experience that doesn't quite allow users to have much control over what is shown - users cannot change or alter what is provided. Smartphones and computers, on the other hand, are much more interactive and in a way providing an immersive experience as well. 

I think augmentation of the reality should go far beyond cell phones or large displays. At my externship this past IAP, I heard a presentation on using data to help create a "smarter city". The project uses information including temperature profile, airflow profile, and building characteristics to help urban planners create a better design of the city. I think projects like that can be a good example of how data dense experience can improve quality of life in the future.
