1. How do you think ML will be used in museums in the future? What are some of the current resistance that limits its use in museums? In the future, what aspects of museum exhibitions does ML have tremendous scope for development?

2. There is a systematic invisible bias in ML (e.g., ML handles light-skinned portraits better than dark-skinned portraits), how can museums take additional steps to correct it and improve ML's recognition of cultural content, thereby building a broader museum community.
