I disagree, new media doesn’t necessarily have “no beginning and no end” or fail to tell stories, I think it is more a matter of artists/storytellers figuring out the language, the affordances of working with new media technologies. Afterall, cinema didn’t start out as a storytelling medium. During the early ages of the movies, films were shown as “nickelodeons” in theaters and these films consisted of watching a person sneeze, a train coming into a station, an elephant being electrocuted, people dancing, etc. Absolutely no narrative involved. It wasn’t until later when directors learned they could move the camera (similar to the idea of the fourth lens that we discussed when talking about the french theater) and make different shots, follow specific characters around, and manipulate lighting/camera angle/etc, did narrative begin to emerge in cinema. It is unfair to assume that this new technology, as cameras were new technologies, will not evolve into a storytelling medium given enough time for creators to explore. 

Manovich asks, how can something something be a story if new elements are added all the time (referring to updating websites and such). I would respond by asking if Manovich thinks that transmedia storytelling is not then, a true method of storytelling and expansion of narrative. After all, transmedia provides a space for fans/creators/artists/producers alike to broaden a particular narrative landscape, an opportunity for constant addition and change, attributes that Manovich seems to think is an exclusionary factor for stories. 

Obviously, our work so far in class leads me to disagree with Manovich that database and narrative are incompatible, as we’ve told stories of sorts using data and various technologies and visualizations to do so — we can liken data to the parts of a film: characters, plot, costume, etc and the technologies/visualizations as the finished product, the film, and the techniques and technologies used to produce it. Obviously, data by itself, without context and without coherent organization does not tell a story, but with this added human element, data can be manipulated/organized in a way that does in fact appear and aide narrative.
