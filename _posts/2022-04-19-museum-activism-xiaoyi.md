The concept of "insider" and "outsider" stood out to me. I resonate a lot with the reading about the constrain of the museum as a social institution which prohibits insiders from inching forward to lasting changes. Though efforts are made to promote decolonized exhibition, just as what author has stated in The Past is Now case study, curators may not always feel easy to take a radical move due to the backlash of the institution itself. Not only in the museum field, but many industries, such as educational institutions, are faced with the same implicit institutional crticism and racism that constraints anti-racial changes.
