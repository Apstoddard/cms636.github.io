I picked the ebook named The Case for Birth Control by Margaret Sanger, and chose one of the conclusion part to analyze. My conclusion is that Voyant is way more better for me than AntConc in terms of understanding the text efficiently and comprehensively. First of all, Voyant is an online tool which supports more import formats than Antconc does. It also can auto detect multi-languages. Who would refuse such an open tool?

Secondly, the UI of Voyant result page is well organized. The word cloud on the top left is quite helpful if you could combine the top right interactive chart. While AntConc is still using the old fashion UI in terms of limited colors, compact text/tags… It is obviously better to have a dashboard page like Voyant, allowing user to compare various result elements while they can also easily direct to specific word or sentences. (Putting the text view on the center of the dashboard is essential

Thirdly, the trend/frequency visualization of Voyant is very straightforward while AntConc is more rational. But the advantage of the latter its analysis of clusters and collocates.
