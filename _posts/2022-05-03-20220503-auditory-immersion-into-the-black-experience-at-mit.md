### Auditory Immersion Into the Black Experience at MIT 
#### An Interview Project Run by Clarence Williams

  Emma Batson, Marina Monsivais, Tiffany Tran
  
  Project Updates:
  -  Settled three-table database model for audio recall
  -  RFID's difficult to come by still; will be presenting with a laptop-based audio version
  -  Finalizing objects (mix of cassette tapes and MIT-related paraphenalia)
  -  Audio grouped into similar topics; to start off, constant audio will be large chunks of one interview at a time (e.g. several questions about pre-MIT for 3 different speakers)
  -  Station groupings determined (currently based on time period)
  -  UI design is happening
  -  LaTeX is hard but Emma knows how to use it <3
