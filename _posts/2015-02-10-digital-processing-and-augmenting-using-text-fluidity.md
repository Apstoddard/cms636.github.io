It's interesting to see the evolution of digital humanities in text fluidity, as people discover more and more ways to process and augment text in useful ways. Not even getting into the processing part of things, due to this fluidity, within years we've gone through so many phases of popular typefaces and such, fads coming and going, the "new" and "modern" look becoming the most common look then falling under a new type fashion. There are also new ways to organize and present text digitally--not only the hyperlinks and such mentioned in the reading but also animation and videos augmenting the words in addition to other visual tools. It's amazing how open-to-change the digital world has transformed humanities to be.

Then the processing of large amounts of texts--we definitely are producing huge amounts of unprocessed data at unparalleled rates. This data is so unorganized in its current state--some on this site, some on that one--and one could say that, like in the reading, we're shifting to the "collective" and "aggregated" voice over the individual ones, but you could also say that the crazy amount of sites and databases on the web are hardly congregated at all, making the data harder to process as a whole. We have made great advances in the field--there are so many companies founded purely on data management and presentation/visualization, let alone analyses of that data. Even a lot of research and coding challenges are out there to encourage contribution to this part of digital humanities.

To use the example in the reading, it's easy to look at a word usage in a text over a huge database of texts. But we have a long way to go in the semantic interpretation of that text. Before the digital, humanities didn't have that issue--a human reader can easily interpret the definition of a word as used in a text. To engage in the semantic use of a word is significantly more difficult when we use digital tools. As easy as it is to scale this processing online, we've yet to match humans in the more subtle interpretations of data.
