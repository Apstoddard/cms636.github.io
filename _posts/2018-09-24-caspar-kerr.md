Caspar is an exchange student from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, spending his fourth year of a 5-year Master's of Industrial Design Engineering (which is more interaction design and less engineering than you'd think) at MIT. He is interested in technology and movies, and really likes cross country skiing (which is probably among the top 3 most Norwegain activities that no one else seems to have an interest in). In addition to that, he also has a mild addiction to science videos and video essays on YouTube.
