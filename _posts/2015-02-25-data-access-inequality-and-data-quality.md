title: Data Access Inequality and Data Quality
category: updates
---

I personally found the most interesting part of this article the interplay between data access inequality and the quality of that data.

As the article states, Twitter's data is not necessarily better just because there's more of it. If there are sampling biases in their streaming APIs, or even if researchers assume that twitter represents all of humanity equally, then the data itself must be carefully understood. At the same time, the people who have access to this data in full are often the most priveleged of researchers, leading to a new divide in research. Those who have access are the only ones who can effectively ask their questions of the data, but because of the high barrier to entry, we will not only have biased data but also bias the research being done on this data.

The question that these two points raise is of equality in research and our technoogical advances. When the research being done on this data is only relevant to the people who can use Twitter, or even use medical devices that log their data, the benefits and answers that it can provide will be only effective towards that user set.
