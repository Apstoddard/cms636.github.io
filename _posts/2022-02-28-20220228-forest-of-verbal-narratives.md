## Forest of Verbal Narratives

  Something we discussed previously was the difficulty of presenting audio, as auditory processing is thought to be very singular. However, you can process a conversation with multiple overlapping speakers or in a crowded room, and you can distinguish the varying sounds of instruments or animals in an auditory forest (tangled "objects," in this case sound waves and statues). I want to create an exhibit based solely on sounds for the Black experience at MIT project; you are walking through a group of statues or stands representing different individuals. Each set is having a "conversation" that is weaving together the individual's interview audio files. You can walk up to the individuals and hear their "conversation" and read information attached to the stand while other audio plays in the background, listening to a symphony of perspectives on the Black experience at MIT.
  
  Audience is anyone, experience is enhanced for people who have hearing ability but is accessible for those without.
  
  This exhibit would be specific to the MIT Museum, but this concept can be applied to other audio collections.
  
  Technology needed would be speakers and the ability to parse through interview/audio recordings to create a cohesive conversationa and story. This would likely require coding and some creativity for placements/groupings of stories.
