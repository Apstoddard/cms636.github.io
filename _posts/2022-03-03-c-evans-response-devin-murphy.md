I think the main shift in curation exemplified in this article is one from a place where the curator is mostly expected to offer their expertise in a very overt way to the visitor, to one where the curator is part of a museum-wide mission to make the learning that happens in museums more participatory. Evans mentions this shift being possible due to open-mindedness in considering the curator's role, and collaboration amongst curators and other museum staff. When Evans talks about the nature of this collaboration in the permanent exhibits at the CMA, I think she illuminates the importance of the curator in designing these participatory exhibits. That expertise comes in handy when you are thinking about what types of pieces to exhibit under a common theme, and even for offering insight into what knowledge a museum visitor could possibly take away from an exhibit.
