I tried the voyant tools with ten years of scanned Platform magazines from GSD, the statistics is one that you would expect with architecture-related terms.

The jstor text analyzer seems a little more informative than the first one with topics extracted.
But it's hard to verify what the algorithm is behind. It's not very convincing that airports and border protection are among the most frequent in ten years.

The topicgraph tool makes most sense to me as it defines topic on a group of related terms rather than just one word or phrase. It didn't work with the uploaded texts so I clicked on one of the examples.
