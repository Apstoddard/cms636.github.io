## Digital Humanities, A. Burdick

I thought it was interesting how this piece tried to address the issue of creating a contemporary definition of a collection, especially after our Tuesday discussion over what a collection actually entails. I greatly enjoyed the imagery & relevancy of this line about cataloging these large collections:
  
> ...catologing can put into play a vivid mode of representation that is... a composition that treads along the boundary line between verbal and visual figuration in the pursuit of informational concision and compactness. (32) >
  
Do these digital archives even count as real collections in the context of museum collections? Do they need to be archived & cataloged with the same artness as pre-digital archives? Internet culture should reasonably be documented and analyzed for future generations, however it is important to consider how we should catolog & pick through these readily available resources. It seems that NFT's could prove to be important in curatorial pursuits of museums, as they are defined as the **original** or primary source of a particular aspect of internet-documented history. It would be interesting to see if & how museums move more into the internet space and how they interact with this new era of digital content.
