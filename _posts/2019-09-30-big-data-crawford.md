-## A New Post

I think the issues raised here are interesting, but not all are necessarily new. The ethical issues, and limitations of the data are tru in other types of reseacher. 

I did think some of the programming issues that can create a bias are new. when she writes "It is the kind of data that encourages the practice of apophenia: seeing patterns where none actually exist, simply because massive quantities of data can offer connections that radiate in all directions." I was reminded of another reasing (was it fromt our first class perhaps) regarding machine learning which discovers patterns because it is told to look for patterns. Often the issue is that until work is repeated, and has a different result or cannot be replicated the problem is not known. In statistics there are tests to ensure a sample is representative of a larger population – or equally to disprove it. I am wondering how if peer review or retesting (as in science) is being used at all?

I think people are generally aware of some of the issues she raises regarding Twitter. ie There are other problems with big data, or at least its ability to represent a larger population. Particularly types of people participate on Twitter, not everyone. Cleaning must involve to her point things like considering ghost accounts and people with multiple accounts, fakes and bots.  Although I think much of this can be solved by the researcher being careful in what they curate and what they claim. I am not sure that the biases here are different from the biases in old-fashioned research. For example I think it’s fair to assume that a random sample of North American politicians or journalist on twitter would be a fairly accurate sample representation of the whole population, as most journalists and politicians are in Twitter and under their true identities (in terms of names). The issue then becomes is the question answerable/knowable via Twitter? 

Some of the issues raised seem to already have methodologies in other disciplines which would limit the problems she raises. Is the problem that there is no consistency or "rule book" for big data?
