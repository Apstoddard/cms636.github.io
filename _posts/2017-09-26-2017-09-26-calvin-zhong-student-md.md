Hey, I'm Calvin! I'm an aspiring engineer-turned-architect-turned-social-scientist in the Department of Architecture + Comparative Media Studies. In Architecture, I focus on digital fabrication and design computation and TA How to Make (Almost) Anything and in CMS, I work on human-centered design and leverage digital media for social impact.
