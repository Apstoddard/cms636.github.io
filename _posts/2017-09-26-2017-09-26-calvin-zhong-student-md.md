Hey, I'm Calvin! I'm an aspiring engineer-turned-architect-turned-social-scientist in the Department of Architecture + Comparative Media Studies. I am interested in digital fabrication and design computation, TA How to Make (Almost) Anything, work on human-centered design, and leverage digital media for social impact.
