title: possible project connections - devin

I think my project of connecting stories has some overlap with Trudy's project of creating graph visualizations of visitor engagement. I would be super interested in exploring what insights we can give both users and museums by making such visualizations.

I also think there is some overlap between my project and Marina's and Emma's audio installations, as they focus a bit more on creating compelling narratives through museum installations. I think it would be super cool to work with audio and have done some audio processing in the past that might come in handy for this.
