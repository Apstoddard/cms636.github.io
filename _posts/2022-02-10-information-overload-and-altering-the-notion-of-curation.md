The notion of contemporary curation has pervaded itself into daily activity in an age of information overload. While curation has traditionally been something that is trained and developed in a scholarly sense, curation has been forced upon everyone today. There exists a natural expectation in the modern human to be self-responsible for their choices of information intake -- be it digital platform or media form. "Filtering", "organizing", and "caring for" information is any normal beings' task now on a daily basis, and the rise of the digital age has brought together "exclusive" knowledge of the past and basic information into one accessible place. The times we live in have fundamentally altered the boundaries of what and who can curate, and it's no wonder even businessmen view themselves as curators nowadays.
