## Data Production/Cleaning vs. Dissemination

## Database as a Limiting Factor?

While talking about the shift from the syntagmatic to the paradigmatic in the manifestation of new media, Manovich  makes the statement that new media causes us to mistake "selection" for "creation". It is true that the "interactive narrative" structures presented via new media (e.g, make your-own-story novels, video games with multiple alternate outcomes, such as [Heavy Rain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Rain), or [The Stanley Parable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stanley_Parable)) are in fact all limited to finite possible, meaningful connections. So the process of merely using an interactive interface could be seen as an act of selection. However, I have a hard time agreeing with Manovich's claim that "the cognitive processes in understanding any cultural text(...)" are in any way diminished or eliminated, or replaced in this process.

It seems like Manovich sees the physical manifestation of the paradigmatic in the form of databases as a limiting factor to the human trail of thought. He believes that a presented network of conected data points makes things explicit to the point where we are limited in how we interpret these points. However, I have a much more optimistic approach to this situation; a perspective similar to Vannevar Bush
