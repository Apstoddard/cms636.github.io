The [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) software package is a great way to get started using APIs to work with data. To simply view JSON files in a readable format in your browser, you can use the JSONView extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/nn-NO/firefox/addon/jsonview/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en).

For a (very) brief introduction to JSON, see the [What Is JSON](https://cms633.github.io/assets/What%20is%20JSON.pdf) document.
