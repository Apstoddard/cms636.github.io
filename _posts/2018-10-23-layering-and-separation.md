In the chapter "Layering and Separation," Tufte explains how even complicated data need not look that way and how quality design can distill information visually into an understandable form. Tufte remarks on the following effects on understanding:

### Figure and Ground
To distinguish figure and ground, Tufte recommends using color, shade, and weight delibrately and meaningfully. A mess of black lines with the same thickness conveys little information; shading unimportant things in lighter colors helps indicate where focus should be placed. When there are multiple sets of information interacting with each other-like labels for each part of a diagram-bold color (like red) can help indicate its importance. However, bold colors must be used sparingly-an abundance of bold colors against a white background can be visually jarring.*

### Interaction Effects
Borders should not be the visual focus of the image-the information should. Boxes surrounding information should be enough to indicate separation, but they should serve no other decorative purpose. Using "small spots of intense, saturated color" can help increase the focus to the actual information, especially when constrasted with the rest of the image.

### 1 + 1 = 3 or more
Negative space can be as important as positive. When you draw 2 lines, you do not only see those 2 lines. You also see the space in between them. These 2 lines can also be drawn in many different ways-right next to each other, parallel, crossing at various angles, etc. Each method conveys a different meaning. Using this concept, we can be more aware of using negative space meaningfully (for example, to depict roads) and notice when we've added too many elements in (for example, excessive bordering)


*This sounds like a symptom of the times, as design nowadays tends to employ incredibly bold uses of color and strong constrast. On the other hand, given how stressed out we are, perhaps we should listen to Tufte and calm our designs down.
