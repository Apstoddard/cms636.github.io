This is the first time for me to experience a complete virtual reality exhibition. Some of the features shown during this experience did impress me, but at some points it was still far from a pleasant journey. Below are the pros and cons of the exhibition.
pros:
1 This exhibiton is promoting a concept of "Experiential Journalism", which can provide the audience with "spatial immediacy" and the opportunity to "re-live" the encounters with the combatant.For an exhibition in forms of interviews, the VR technology does help engaging audienceâ€™s attention and interest in the content of interview. The  combatants are nicely modeled with fine details where you can even see the blood streak in their eyes and these eyes are even dynamically oriented towards you to add to more reality.   This provides better sensing of the context and underlying attitudes, which can not be explicitly conveyed through descriptive texts and too flatly conducted through a 2D screen.
