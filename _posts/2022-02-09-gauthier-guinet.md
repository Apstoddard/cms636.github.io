Gauthier is currently a PhD candidate at the MIT Operations Research Center. From a broad perspective, he enjoys using technology and design to address operational challenges in a participatory and personalized way. He truly believes that knowing a little bit about a lot of things is not only very interesting but also surprisingly useful. This has led him to collaborate in the past on many diverse projects with newspapers, neuroscientists, tech companies or even hedge funds. You can find more information about these projects on his [website](https://gguinet.github.io). In his spare time lately, he is trying to learn anthropology, imitate [Sarah Sze](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/sarah-sze-interview-tateshots) and start a newsletter.
