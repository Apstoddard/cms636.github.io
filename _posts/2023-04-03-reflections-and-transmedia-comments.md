**Amy Hollander: Reflections on the Future of Museum Storytelling**

Question 1. Is the traditional museum unwelcoming to large portions of our society?

This question is pretty tricky. There’s a lot of art out there in the world, even if you filter so as to only consider especially culturally influential pieces. And yet if you step into most museums you end up walking through the same kinds of general exhibits that all come from a pretty eurocentric progression. Exhibits about other cultures often feel tacked on to me, or have this strong air of being from an outsider looking in. A lot of [non-upper class] [non-white] audiences might not feel represented or even really want to see more of this same perspective throughout the museum.

Question 3: How can we best reach underserved communities?

One resolution I can think of is to more consciously focus on the less traditionally seen audiences with more community driven exhibits. While I was visiting the NOMA in Louisiana, I visited several exhibits about non-American cultural histories. I noticed that the Japanese history exhibit did a good job of blending ancient and contemporary art, while the India exhibit did little to tie its pieces of Indian religious art and sculpture back to the lived experience of Indian people. It was a little like being represented only by a handful of religious icons, and ignoring all the other parts of a modern cultural identity. Being more conscious about accidentally othering underserved communities or just other groups would go a long way!

Question 6: How can a small museum, with a limited staff and budget, implement such grand efforts?

One of the easiest solutions to this is to try to get important cultural items from the community itself. In general, I believe/hope that people appreciate being respectfully represented. My perception of the issue (as in question 1) is that museums too often focus on presenting fine or modern arts exhibits which have a tendency to feel either too eurocentric or frustratingly high-concept for an everyday visitor. Visiting the NOMA I expected to see more context behind New Orleans' rich cultural history, but instead saw dozens of fine art pieces and semi-important American paintings. I don’t mean to dig on the NOMA too much, but I do think it fails to adequately represent the culture and history of the people who would probably want to visit it! Both encouraging more donations and allotting more space to exhibits that appeal more to underserved groups would hopefully lead to a positive feedback loop.

**Soraia Ferreira: Can You Apply Transmedia Storytelling to Museums?**

The Idea of transmedia storytelling for museums is pretty interesting, although I don’t think it’s explained particularly well in the article. My guess for how it would be used is something like approaching the overarching theme/goal of the museum in several different mediums or ideas. As is, I think many museums could do with exploring more mediums and building a connection between pieces in different mediums in the same exhibit. The whole idea kind of reminds me of the project that Tiffany, Razan, Aron, and Candy are doing, although I don’t know how much it directly connects to my own group's project.
