-I think the point about search engines being implemented when actual browsing tools would be better suited for the task is interesting and very relevant. It made me think about MIT’s own library catalog, and how hard it is to just browse or look through this collection using their search feature unless you sort of know what you are looking for.
-I’m noticing some parallels between their research life cycle and ours, specifically the Design and Programming stages and the tradeoffs/conversations that sometimes happen between designers and programmers. In our project group, we’ve already had conversations about complex designs versus efficient implementations. We’re trying to balance the idea of making a design that is creative and addresses a problem in a relevant and unique way with what we believe to be technically achievable or within the scope/timeline available for this project.
-A lot of this article reminds me of the first iteration of our final project, which essentially was intended to be a browsing tool for stories. In some ways I think this affirms some of the things we would have liked to accomplish with that interface, creating a new way of viewing these stories that would maybe encourage users to spend a little bit more time with them, or at least have a better sense of navigating them.
