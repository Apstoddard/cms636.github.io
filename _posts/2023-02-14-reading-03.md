It is interesting to learn about how the digital world is restoring some historical information. Without technology, it would not have been possible to rely on memory or other means of inventory. However, since collections are the archetype of knowledge production, the abundance of knowledge dilutes their values. The book used the terms "collection-building" and "curation" in several instances and sometimes interchangeably. It was only at the end of the text that it brought forth the importance of curation and what it means to be a curator. A collection has its own unique value because it typically narrates a story that its collector gets to portray. Nevertheless, when a collection loses its sense of uniqueness and its story, it becomes a mere tool of accumulation or clutter and loses its sense of curation. Digital curation needs to strike a balance between the two. Digital curation should not lose the human touch, as knowledge production is a purely social practice.
