## The Participatory Museum

In the article, writer mentions that "Rather than delivering the same content to everyone, a participatory institution collects and shares diverse, personalized, and changing content coproduced with visitors." This brings me to the concept of "personalized learning". In a personalized learning environment, students have the flexibility and autonomy to choose and explore different resources in the space, which allows them to connect the process of exploration and learning with their interests and passions, making learning a fun and engaging process. Likewise, when a museum becomes a participatory institution, it empower visitors and give them freedom. Visitors are not just unilaterally viewing and touring the exhibitions, but are more likely to be thinking, reflecting, communicating, and creating in the space. Such a decentralized model can effectively help visitors immerse themselves into the entire museum space.

## At The Foot Of The Hill

My biggest impression is that the designers of the museum provide a situated exploration environment and experience for all the visitors. The whole space and touring experience are carefully evaluated and sequenced. For example, after enjoying the natural views on the roof, visitors will descend to the cave facsimile. The changes in descending scenes mimic the experience of the cave's first explorers, so that visitors have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the scenes surrounding the explorers back then, and similarly experience the process of psychological change from curiosity to awe that the explorers experienced at that time. In the cave, the designers also carefully set the temperature, humidity, and lighting changes, which make the artwork in the cave more sacred. Therefore, visitors are more likely to reflect and contemplate.

I also noticed that Lascaux IV has no educational texts or descriptive labels on the walls, and I really appreciate this kind of design. Since there may be more than one interpretation of the exhibits, the designer provides space for visitors to slowly look at those artworks and interpret the objects based on their own perceptions and understanding.Â
