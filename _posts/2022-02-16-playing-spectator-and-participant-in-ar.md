## Tamiko Thiel's “Cyber-Animism and Augmented Dreams”

Although it wasn't elaborated on much, I was intrigued by the direction Tamiko Thiel began to take with the idea of "infiltrating places that governments kept under tight control." The blunt opposition to authority, as seen by tweet balloons let loose inside the White House or resurrecting the Goddess of Democracy in Tiananmen Square, made me interested in the idea of spectatorship _and_ participation in AR. This handheld, digital rebellion that can now exist because of augmented reality, works because of the "lack of worry about the political consequences if people are caught trying to look at them." Viewership of this work in the AR space might even transcend the traditional spectator experience that exists in museums. Viewers of pieces in the AR-scape, in their nature by "infiltrating" these places, in some sense become active participants rather than just observers. While museum-goers are by default always in a safe haven of judgement and observation, observers in the AR space assume an increased role of participation by sharing the same concealment/anonyminity as the artists' and activists themselves. The idea of surpassing the role of spectator to become participant interests me, especially in novel methods of artistic presentation and use of "space". In some sense, the rise of artistic commentary in AR might not only extend the museum space per se, but also extend the stake at which museum-goers put themselves in by immeresing themselves in the experience.
