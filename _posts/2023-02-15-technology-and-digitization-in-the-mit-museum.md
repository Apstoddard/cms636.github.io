Our Findings:
+ The Voice of AI Exhibit: 
	- Use of motion detection instead of a typical button to start the recorded audio clip
   - Require standing still to hear the entire clip
   - Makes the experience more interesting than pressing a button, but we felt that it wasn't exactly adding to what the clips are talking about. The visual of seeing a big speaker in front of you is nicer than staring at nowhere
+ Arthur Ganson Exhibit (moving machines)
	- The contraptions only start moving when one stands right in front of it
   - Forces the viewer to stay close to the machines in order to see the intricate details instead of just glancing from afar
   - Perhaps saves power
   - The whale machine uses stimulate different senses instead of just visual (sound and feel)
+ Virtural Tools Game
	- Using the touchscreen allows way more interactivity than staring at a video demonstrating it instead
   - Visitors can physcially play with the exhibit in a way that a wall of text and pictures cannot
+ Poem Writing AI Exhibit
	- Using the extended screen to show past poems in a very interesting way
   - Could potentially be replaced with a printer and a physcial wall that people can pin their poems onto in whatever way they want
