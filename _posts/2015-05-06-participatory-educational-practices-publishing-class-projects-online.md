In defining the elements of a participatory culture, Henry Jenkins includes relatively low barriers for artistic expression and civic engagement. However, (as ia also mentioned in the text), a low barrier in expression shouldn't neccesserily mean a decrease in quality; particularly if the participatory culture is not one that developed naturally through novel opportunitites in information communication, but rather in a guided manner - e.g. in a classroom.

Under the guidence of a teacher or professor, participatory projects that result in a public end-product can be extremely powerful teaching tools in improving expression and writing skills. In this scenario, the teacher acts as a critic of ideas and forms of expression (as s/he usually does). But it is also important for the teacher to be encouraging, which is how artistic expression is made more accessible for students.

Digital Humanities as a class has actually been an amazing resource in helping me develop these kind of skills. Both tools like annotationstudio, and the github-based website itself are amazing tools for participatory projects. The fact that everything I have written for this class is becoming public, including not just projects and polished texts, but also commentaries, has made me much more self-aware about contributing to a public domain. It has equiped me with the awareness of writing for the public, but not in a youtube-comment-mess way, but rather in a clear and concise manner.
