Based on the feedback we received, we filtered down our proposal into 3 separate outputs: 

A museum website for curators and visitors with Instagram posts and analytics. This site is intended to help the museum curate new experiences, and for visitors to view the collection through a social lens.

A visitor curation experience using Instagram stories. The museum will generate prompts that focus on less explored works and areas of the museum, for example: "what are your favorite objects from x collection? what are your favorite blue objects?"

A visitor game experience using Instagram stories. Similar to the visitor curation experience, the museum asks visitors to photograph and tag objects that are less viewed. The person who wins will get an award(?) or achievement (?).

The visitor Instagram stories from the curation and game experience will be shared with the museumâ€” They have the option to share (repost) these on their official account. This also allows the museum to engage with these individuals on Instagram, starting a dialogue about these works. This interaction via Instagram allows the museum to further understand visitor behaviors and interests.
