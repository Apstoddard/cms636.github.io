- Does the computing capacity of machine learning AI open up new dimensions to understand computer history, one that might not have happened otherwise?
- How to define CHM as an interface to immateriality of software and digit matrix, or how would you define CHM that is different from an interface. Who has agency to steer the communication process(audience or museum professionals)?
- Is there any workshop as a form of engagement for non-computer savvy people?
- Any programs that construct thematic correlation among collections to engage and build up conversation with more audience?
