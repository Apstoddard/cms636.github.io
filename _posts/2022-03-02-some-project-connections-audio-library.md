title: Some Project Connections - Audio Library
author: Emma Batson
---
I think the key component of my audio library idea is the concept of trying to add a certain physicality to otherwise nonphysical collections. As such, there is a lot of overlap with Devin's desire to create a fitting exhibit for documenting East Campus culture, which itself demands a certain interactivity and physicality. It's interesting to think about how this could combine with Marina's Forest of Verbal Narratives since both are audio projects. There's a certain challenge to neatly combining ideas for a more ephemeral "sound-scape" exhibit with an attempt to make audio more physical -- but it also could make for a powerful contrast. On a different track, this project might be compatible with Tiffany's Interactive Replicas, since both are aiming to physically connect visitors to otherwise untouchable collections.
