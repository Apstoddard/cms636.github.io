## Project Background
Children are born into history. They have no memory of it, yet they find themselves in the middle of a story that began before they became one of its characters. Children also want to have a place in history. However, given the limited ability of their reading ability and cognitive development, engaging children with history is not an easy task.Nonetheless, there's one thing children enthusiastic about and probably do better than we expected them to be----playing games, which provides a good opportunity to involve children into a learning process at the same time having a lot of fun.

This project aims right at addressing the question of how we can effectively engage childrren with historical learning using an educational game, the target audience of which are pre-school children. This game can prepare them with a preliminary sense of history before they receive proper historical education at school.

The aspect of history covered in the game is about the evolution of everyday table objects encountered by children in their daily life. By decorating tables from different time period(eg.Roman Emoire era, Medieval era, Industrial Revolution era etc.), children will realise that things around them actually don't always stay immutable as they are when they were born but in constant envolution in history, thus forming a sense of temporality in everything around them.
