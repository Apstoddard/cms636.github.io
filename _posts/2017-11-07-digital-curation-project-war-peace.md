title: 'Digital Curation Project: War + Peace?'

For this project, after examining the metadata and images, I decided I wanted to create an exhibit that would explore the juxtaposition of war related photos and festival related photos in this particular neighborhood. The story I wanted to tell with these images and these exhibits is how events of mass anger, sadness, and fear could occur in a place where mass happiness, joy, and energy exists as well (not necessarily at the same time). 

I went through and used the subject column to filter for the appropriate war and festival tagged photos, and then extracted the 31 photos'metadata I would use for the for the exhbit website, and then obtained the relative photos.

Using Omeka was a confusing experience. I decided to go with making two items, War and Peace, and adding the images to the items. It was a slight pain that you had to upload photos individually, and I could see that being a barrier to building larger exhibits without arduous amounts of time. I also found it very confusing to import the CSV and match the photos to the metadata. I think it would have been easier to write a script to generate web pages matching the images to the csv. If I had more time, I would have tried using the Google Open Gallery tool.
