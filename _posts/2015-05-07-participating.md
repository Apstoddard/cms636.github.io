We were assigned Catcher in the Rye as summer reading the summer before freshman year of high school. I remember trying to rush through reading it the few days before classes started, and I found it a kinda boring, plotless story. Then classes started, and we discussed the story, and all of a sudden there was so much more meaning to the story. Catcher in the Rye became a completely different book to me. I could even say I liked it. I definitely appreciated it. How is it that I read it in such a way, missing all this meaning, back in the summer?

You get a lot out of reading a book like a classic, but you definitely get so much more from hearing other peoples' thoughts on it, debating with them on the interpretations, and forming your own conclusions from what you have heard and thought about. Having an environment that fosters that kind of discussion is critical. Technology is one good way of making that discussion more widespread and accessible, so that a long and boring read alone becomes a meaningful read with others.

It's also interesting to see old books with a modern context, as the Moby Dick play mentioned in the reading took a look at. Even if it is not context it was originally intended for--or even because it is not so--you can get a lot of meaning out of a book. It's no longer "the author intends this," but rather, "we see this." Interpretations can have wide applicability.

I sorta see a parallel, actually, to STEM here. STEM can feel kind of distant and inaccessible to most. But here at MIT, we have such a participatory culture for STEM that encourages even dropping references to math/physics/etc concepts into casual conversation. The approachbility of STEM is also a gap we're trying to bridge, and we are trying to make use of technology to encourage STEM. Use of technology is not perfect for everything, but it can definitely be an aid.
