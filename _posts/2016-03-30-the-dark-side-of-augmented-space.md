title: The Dark Side of Augmented Space
---

The Manovich paper explores how technology has overlaid physical spaces with a technological landscape and how hardware and software is beginning to integrate the physical world with a virtual one. I believe this is an important discussion to have because of the grave security concerns that it poses. As more of our environments (such as home security systems, commercial billboards, and government surveillance systems) are integrated with technology, they become vulnerable to the threat of network intrusion. They also affect individual privacy and give more power to those in command of technological architectures. It is important to consider the ramifications of Augmented Space and to establish principles to abide by; otherwise, we will be forced to consider the problem once it is too late to make easy changes.
