Digital humanities are a collaborative process.  I was struck by this statement, both in its repetition and by in the suggestion that perhaps the humanities is not a solitary subject and profession.  Throughout my humanities education, though short in its breadth,  I have grown accustomed to solidarity, to a solitary process of writing essays and conducting research, as this was the model set forth in class and history.  In fact, when it comes to humanities, I often avoid group essays and would prefer work independent of others.  However, the field of Digital Humanities seems to require collaboration from its scholars and disciples.  The suggestion that humanities should be a collaborative, project-based discipline is to change the process by which the humanities are taught and studied.  While the concept of collaborative humanities projects seems foreign to me, the digital format in which the information is presented and manipulated lends itself to a collective.  The text referred to the idea of fluid textuality, where texts are constantly produced, duplicated, and evolved to fit different medias and authors preferences.  This kind of collaborative work begets a greater and more multifaceted wealth of knowledge.  I am curious to see how the study of digital humanities will affect the classic study of humanities, and to see how the digital age will bleed into a field that has existed independent of the digital world.
