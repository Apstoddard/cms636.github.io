I'm torn regarding how I feel towards the Internet Archive. On one hand, I think it is incredibly important and useful to keep some collection of past versions of web pages, because if we don't then we are essentially letting a significant part of history (in the form of online content) slip through our fingers. On the other hand, I am concerned that the Wayback Machine, along with any other internet archive, will mainly become a dump of information that is nearly impossible to wade through. I agree with Lepore's point that if everything on the Internet is saved, then there might be too much of it for anyone to make sense of any of it. This problem is mainly exacerbated by the fact that currently the contents of the archive are not sorted, indexed, or catalogued, and hardly searchable. If even researchers find it too cluttered to put to good use, then that should be a warning that perhaps a change should be made to the organization of the internet archives, by placing higher emphasis on its utility rather than simply crawling for more and more information.
