One of the most inetresting points made in _The Future of Museums and Libraries: A Discussion Guide_, is the shift in authority figures in charge of the organization and presentation of information at GLAMs. The idea of "crowdsourced curation" is implied in the second bulleetpoint of the text. This concept seems appealing at first, and it seems to have worked well in the Wing Luke Asian Museum and Lab of Art and Ideas at Belmar examples listed in the report. However its important to note that even these community-curated galeries/museums are limited to the local community. So even though the concept of an "expert curator" is overridden with ideas of collaboration and contribution by larger groups of people, the it still seems limited to local communities. So is it  possible to have a truly "open-source" presentation of knowledge at GLAMs , without having them turn into disorganized, chaotic Wikipedia-like venues?

I think that expert-guided curation to the point of generation meaningful modules or packets of knowledge is essential. In my opinion, the most effective independance in knowledge organization would be at the individual level. Instead of having communities or large groups of people literally curate and determine the organization of a museum, the expert-curated modules in a museum should be presented in a modular, flexible fashion. My favorite museum experiences have been ones where there is no direct path or order to follow things; rather I as an observer get to create my own story, or "curate" my own collection of knowledge. This experience is often further augmented with integration of technology into the experience, that allows me to interact freely with the presented knowledge.

My favorite example for this is my favorite museum experience of all time: Haus Der Musik located in Vienna. In particular the top two floors of this museum were amazing. As you enter either one of these floors, you enter a large space wth various rooms with no implied "right path" to take. Each room has various elements relationg to the history and the science behind sound. Additionally, most installations are interactive, and they allow you to generate original experiences as you receive well-curated knowledge in parallel.

So although the idea of a crowd-curated collection sounds appealing at first, I think theshift in authority should not be directly to the community, but rather the individual.
