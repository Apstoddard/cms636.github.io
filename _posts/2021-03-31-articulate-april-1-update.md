## Concept Updates

## Wireframe Updates
We've updated the wireframe to display one (randomized) comment at a time, with a button to view the next randomly selected comment. We've also added a screen for replying to an existing comment. We decided that the user would be able to view other people's responses without having to submit commentary of their own.

## Code
We've started looking at documentation in more detail and performing some early tests to make sure our selected tools will work the way we're expecting.
