### The Experience Economy

> Engaging themes integrate space, time, and matter into a cohesive, realistic whole.

Space is a major part that establishes identity and the flow of the exhibits, and it is an opportunity to enhance the transformative visitor experience. However, exhibitions can overemphasize the collection of valuable objects or well-designed activities while overlooking the rooms that house them. I have also seen that lots of art museums change the exhibits and collections without changing the space and the design of the interface. Although iconic matter can draw visitors, it might make the experience uninviting. Space should be viewed as an integral part of the experience and should evolve to meet the changing needs of story-telling and the nature of the exhibits.

### First-time and Repeat visitors

The study has put forward an important discussion that a museum can better serve its purpose by identifying its visitors and matching its exhibits, programming, events, and promotional material to meet their needs. Design should go over the process of empathy, design, development, implementation, and testing to improve experience. Nevertheless, I do think that the data gathered in this study may be subjective since it came from a self-reported questionnaire. It is not clear what the difference in satisfaction levels is between first-time visitors and repeat visitors in a larger context, as there are many other uncontrolled factors that can influence the research results or have future implications.Â
