GIS has many advantages in its ability to manage and visualize data, solve spatial problems, deal with large amounts of data, measure with great precision (as it can be replicated and verified), reveal patterns that would otherwise remain hidden in statistical analyses, and spur intuitive interpretation. 

However, there are many disadvantages that Bodenhamer discusses that I would have never previously considered. The major theme of GIS critics' arguments revolves around the "positivist" nature of GIS - that spatial information is all derived from empirical data and analyses. They believe that GIS lacks cultural context and knowledge necessary to understand the true nature of spaces, and so it produces and perpetuates "uncritical", "naive", biased, and/or inaccurate images of the world. They argue that the reality of spatiality is closely intertwined with social and cultural influences that get excluded with GIS, as it "delineates space" as merely "a set of Cartesian coordinates" with attached attributes, rather than a "relational space that maps interdependencies" and "societal complexit[ies]". Because of this exclusion, GIS often lies on Western-favoring conceptions/assumptions, and corporate-favoring motivations.
