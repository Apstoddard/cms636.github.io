> deceptive visualization:  â€œa graphical depiction of information,
designed with or without an intent to deceive, that
may create a belief about the message and/or its components,
which varies from the actual message"

Throughout the article, I was thinking about whether or not all visualizations are a bit deceptive, in that we all have our own biases and personal beliefs which get projecte to our work, often unconsciously. I think the answer to that is no. I think there are some messages that are truly unbiased (for example: the population of Wisconsin has increased by 20,000 over the last two years, at an average rate of 1000 people/month; there are 15000 more words in the Old Testament than the New Testament) that can and should be visualized without deception.

I find it interesting that line graphs were found to be the most deceptive (in this specific example, and when compared to a bar and circle graph) when they are arguably the most common in the Real World and in academia. (I do not have evidence for this statement, but having read through a significant number of course 6 papers, that has been my experience.) I wonder if the simplicity of the line makes it easier to manipulate, or perhaps people are just worse at interpreting lines compared to interpreting areas.

They gave this as an example of a deceptive line graph, but I have seen graphs like this (where the axis is changed so that the slope seems steeper/lower, and fits into a graph more nicely) __all the time__ in scholarly publications. This ties into the whole culture of "perish or publish" in academia. Nobody wants to read about inconclusive results, so people will fudge with the data a bit to make it seem like there is a conclusion to be made, even when the unfiltered data says otherwise. Of course, publishing is necessary for tenure-track postions, prestigious postdocs, grad student fellowships, etc. It is a huge problem in academia and probably at MIT, that doesn't seem to have an easy solution without a major shift in academic culture.
