## Review of Bullock Museum

  The Bob Bullock Museum in Austin, Texas is a Texas History museum that attempts to mix in classic Texas History (Mexican Revolution, Texas Revolution, etc.) with more current cultural topics such as an “artifact spotlight” exhibiting the physical mixtapes of DJ Screw, a Houston hip hop artist. I feel that it is a valid attempt to move the museum forward & modernize it, especially finding creative ways to include perspectives of the community which it serves. Having been before, I know it to be an enjoyable experience – especially their 4D movies that they have offered for >15 years – but based on the website I think I would not be particularly inclined to visit this museum over other activities. 
  
  The website itself feels outdated (the layout may have been established in the late 80’s), but the information seems as though the museum is trying to increase engagement with its audience. The museum is currently having a Member Appreciation Month celebration with “special offerings” listed on its front page, promoting to patrons these incentives to visit. There are also special days for certain educational demographics (“Homeschool Day” and “Field Trip Day”) that promote educational engagement in the physical museum.
    
  Something interesting on their website is the “Texas Story Project,” where you as the viewer can share your story virtually and “Make your mark on Texas History” as well as read stories from other people. This is a really interesting way to include different people in the history-making process without necessarily having an in-person mutable exhibit. This could perhaps be a fun interactive exhibit, with a mix of reading and hearing peoples’ stories told – especially through the pandemic.
    
  There are educational resources and ways to view parts of the exhibits online, the former seeming to be geared towards children whereas the latter is aimed at adults. There are also interactive pieces of the website that are mimics of what you can find in the physical museum, such as “Campfire Stories” where you can read and listen to the stories of different demographics that helped shape Texas to what it is today. I think that this is an interesting attempt to include various perspectives in Texas History.
