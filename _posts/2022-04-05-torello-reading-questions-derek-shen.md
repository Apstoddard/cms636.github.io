I really enjoyed Torello's insights into the museum space, and how technology can aid replication  within architecture/buildings.

- We've heard about implementations of VR/AR that have been great ideas on paper but haven't been successful in implementation. What do you think needs to change in the "mental process" of museum visitors to make these technologies succesful, if you think it is indeed possible?
- Was there a primary interaction mode in the Plaster Recast that users enjoyed the most? What feature do users really appreciate the most out of interactive, imaginary tools like these?
- Could you expand on what you mean by "too often emerging technologies are approached by designers in a technocentric vacuum"?
- Is there a place for storytelling in the writing of history?
