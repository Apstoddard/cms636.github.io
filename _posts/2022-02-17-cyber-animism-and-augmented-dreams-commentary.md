> Art-making is often if not always a conjuring practice,
bringing that which is there but unseen – thoughts, ideas,
memories, wishes, fantasies – into the visible realm. 



Augmented reality has great potential to help viewers ponder and reflect upon the ideas that extend beyond tangible art. Although AR/VR can enhance the process of turning an abstract concept, memory, or feeling into a visual representation, I think that it’s something that should be used with caution; focusing on the technology erase the story of the art and the artist. Many museums are embedding technology into their exhibitions to keep up with the changing times, but I think it’s important to think about how the technology can enhance the story of the art and artist, and not the other way around.
