> But, as White argues, there is nothing "mere" in the problem of assembling coherent chronologies nor their visual analogues.

Telling stories chronological way does not mean express the datasets in the history in a linear way. The author in this article shows us how historians perceive the narrative of time chronologically. And as people more using the sequence of time as a tool to analyze instead of simply present the datasets in a chronological way, the cartographies have been superimposed more layers of other information (for instance, the charts designed by Charles Joseph Minard ) and the timeline itself has been expressed in multiple correlated layers. All this come with the more complex issue and more presice representation. 

> Addressing the problem of chronology, and especially the problem of visual chronology, means going back to the line, to understand its ubiquity, flexibility, and force. 

In representing the time, the form of lines or written in the linear way is the most common way. However, when different time point or period have the same weight in a cartography, people draw more of the narration instead of the representation of the history. 

For instance, in the Manuscript timeline for Olaf Stapledon's classic 1930 science fiction novel, the time line steadily zooms in and give the author a clear vision of how a certain time period related to a larger time background.
