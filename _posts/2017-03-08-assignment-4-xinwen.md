As an open source map, google fusion table is not as strong as Arc Map since Arc Map have way more tool box and customized setting. Also, its user interface is not as good as Mapbox, which is also a open source map platform because Mapbox could provide a great amount of existing style and allows you to design your own style.

As for this specific map, it would be nice to show the sequence of location in term of the page number of these location.（yellow stands for the earliest）

After adding the sequence of these location, this map is still not user friendly index. Therefore, in my design, once you click one location, it will show related pages and context. It will definitely save the researchers a lot of time to find the corresponding text.
