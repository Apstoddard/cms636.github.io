-  A description of the issue/problem that you are trying to address;

The project takes inspiration from the two The Rape of Europa pieces in Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and vandalism. 

The art world prominently dominated by male artists is replete with female nudity. The eroticized representation has contributed to the power structure of man and woman and a paradigm of gender inequity–femininity as property of man; its compounding effect gets reinforced through every beholding or glimpse in and/or outside a museum. 

The project proposes not an alternative but integrative narrative of the current one congealed with body and flesh.

Technicality: 
1. Machine learn and generate clothes for the naked ladies; 
1. chronically correct clothes / flannel shirts
1. AR via phone screen or website online exhibition (I remember one that shows two juxtaposing images with cursor)

		
-  Challenges;

Museum: Controversy
Technicality: not sure if ML could recognize nudity in various drawing
		
-  The envisioned audience for your project;

Everyone? 
Online and /or onsite
