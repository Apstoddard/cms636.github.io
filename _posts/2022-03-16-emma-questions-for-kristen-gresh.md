- How do you think about telling the stories of photographs, especially the physicality of the printing process and the journey a print took to get to the museum, to visitors that may not be familiar with the technology of analog photography? 

- Does the ubiquity of digital photography make photos, particularly older analog prints, easier or harder to exhibit in a way that's legible and engaging to visitors?

- When a collection has both really famous photos and also really interesting but obscure photos, is it difficult to draw visitors' attention toward the unfamiliar ones? Thinking about, as extreme examples, the way people mob the Mona Lisa or Botticelli's Venus.

- How do you deal with exhibiting photography artifacts beyond prints? For analog photography, maybe that's negatives; for digital photography, totally digital artifacts?

- When doing exhibit design, how do you best showcase black and white photos? No color, but the different amounts of contrast, luminosity, focal points I imagine become more significant?
