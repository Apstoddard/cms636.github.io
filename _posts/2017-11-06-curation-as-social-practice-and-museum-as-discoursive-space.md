title: 'Curation as Social Practice, and Museum as Discoursive Space'
author: Calvin Zhong

Recently, I have been increasingly interested in authorship through curation, which I think is something that is addressed in both articles. The role of the curator is an important point of discussion in both Kreps's _Curatorship as Social Practice_ and Macalik's _The Museum as Discursive Space_. 

In the second reading by Macalik, there is also an introduction of the museum visitor as the museum "user." I think this is a positive evolution from curation as social practice, because it allows for people to really think about what the curator has done as work, just as a piece of art can be critiqued and be a source of discourse. Relating back to authorship-through-curatorship, I think that the role of the curator is really highlighted by Macalik.

_"Mysteriously, the Chinese authorities failed to bow to pressure from the staff of MoMA, Norman Rosenthal and the Serpentine Gallery team dancing in the style of a jaunty horse-rider. "_

One big negative part of curatorship as social practice is highlighted by Kreps: "In Western museum culture, objects are stripped of their social attributes through decontextualization, a process by which objects are detached from some social whole and given new meanings as they are recontextualized within the culture of the museum." One interesting criticism I had been reading involved the fetishization, and a kind of new-Orientalism, surrounding Ai Weiwei. Ai Weiwei, a famous Chinese dissident and artist, has become a sort of go-to artist for Western curators, almost to a point of removing Ai Weiwei's meaning behind his work, and ascribing new, Western contexts. Most recently, I remember seeing a sort of retrospective of Ai Weiwei at the Brooklyn Museum, and there did seem to be a lot of removed contexts.

When curation becomes a social practice, the practices and implications of the curated exhibitions should be discussed. It becomes a "pedagogical opportunity," in which the "users" of the museums can also engage in "negotiation and debate, polarize and politicize..." 

Another interesting example is "The Enemy," not as just a piece that created a kind of actual discursive space, but also thinking about motivations and work of the curator that brought "The Enemy" to the MIT Museum. That exhibition is refreshing-- it combines a new and trending technology, with a uniquely MIT-esque artistic project, and centers immensely on the "user," to encourage discourse not only about the medium, but also the content.
