I found "The Recording that Never Wanted to be Heard" to be particularly thought-provoking, partly because sonification and sound studies are topics that I haven't had much exposure to before.

I would agree with the authors that sight has largely been granted dominance among the senses throughout history, and this also holds true in much of my life experiences. I enjoy creating visual art (as I grew up in a family with some artists in it) and so painting, drawing, and photography became favorite hobbies of mine. Meanwhile, my participation in the musical arts has been limited.

This article discusses how we can transform data between the domains of different senses. As a visual artist, I am both interested in how we can turn sound into visual art, as well as how we can turn visual art into sound. I was actually involved in creating a music visualization system as a project at a hackathon last year. We used an Oculus Rift to create a virtual environment that the user could walk around in while listening to a song of their choice. The environment reacts to the music in real-time; for example, fountains of water bubble up and down with the amplitudes of different frequency bands, and thunder flashes on loud beats. The system also attempts to scrape the lyrics of the song from the web, and analyze whether the sentiment is happy or sad, and the weather adjusts to be rainy or sunny depending on this mood.

In this way, I have previously explored the idea of transforming sound into visuals. However, the idea that this can be a two way process -- that we can transform visuals back into sound -- is a completely new and fascinating idea for me. As a visual artist, I wonder whether there's a way that a painting of mine can be represented as a piece of audio? As the authors state, different senses are better for different things. For example, hearing is good for monitoring things in the background and picking up anomalies, while sight is great for focusing at a single thing at a time.

I have also found sound to generally be a better medium for expressing emotion than sight. For example, a song can much more easily stir my emotions than a painting can (which can be frustrating as a visual artist attempting to create pieces with some level of emotional content), although a cinematic piece with accompanying audio is even better. In this way, I wonder whether the emotional content of a painting can be better perceived as audio rather than as visuals, just as the authors say that a pulsar can be "better heard than seen", which I think is a very provocative idea.

I can also relate this to ideas from my more technical classes, which involve using a Fourier Transform to analyze a signal in the frequency domain rather than the time domain if it makes more sense to do so. Similarly, we can use sonification or visualization to transform data from one sense to another and analyze or modulate the data in different ways. Perhaps a painting could be transformed into audio, combined with a song, and transformed back into an image? The possibilities seem exciting to explore.
