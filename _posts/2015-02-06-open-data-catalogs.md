[dataportals.org](http://dataportals.org/) hosts a huge collection of (collections of) data, organized by place. This is a great source for municipal data sets: for example, zooming down onto Boston will lead you to the [Metro Boston DataCommon](http://metrobostondatacommon.org/), where you can explore visualizations relating to culture and the arts, among many other categories, and export the raw data from those visualizations or from new ones you create.
