In his article, "The Poetics of Augmented Space", Lev Manovich explores the concept of augmented spaces, highlighting several commercial and artistic uses of the idea and its associated technologies.

Though visual augmentations of spaces-- such as signs and public maps-- have long been used in public spaces, the recent development of digital technologies have broadened the use and meaning of augmented space in museums and galleries, schools, transit systems, and other public or semi-public spaces. 

One thematic idea to which Manovich continually returns is that of the panopticon. Though Manovich credits the theory of the panopticon to Michel Foucault, the original idea was developed by Jeremy Bentham, a philosopher and social theorist. Bentham's panopticon is an institutional building, such as a prison, in which a central watch tower looks over a circular array of cells. Though no watchman can view all cells at the same time, it is this same feature that gives this design its power; those held captive cannot know whether or not the watchman is looking at them, so they behave as if they are being watched all the time.

Foucault developed this theory further, broadening the idea to a general theory of social surveillance and control. Even on the street, one never knows if others are watching you, so you begin to act as if you are being watched; that is, you self-police. 

(An aside: This idea has been developed significantly in women's and gender studies; in the case of personal appearance, women in Western societies tend to police their own appearance, as well as critique that of other people. Everyone is a jailor and the jailed in this reading, though some of us have more power than others.)

In the age of digital augmentation of space-- both public and private-- the panopticon no longer exclusively relies on sight. New technologies, such as "cellular and Bluetooth communication, radar, and environmental sensors," rely instead on wireless signals for their communication of data (224). 

As with any discussion of wireless communication, there is a danger that these technologies could be used for nefarious purposes. Manovich touches on this breifly, and, though I have many opinions on this topic, I will not further elaborate on them and will instead discuss one possible "safer" alternative context for these technologies and the application of digitally augmented space: museums.

Some museums already employ technology to augment spaces. For example, the Institute for Contemporary Art in Boston has a mobile guide that users can utilize to view videos and hear artists speak about their work. The museum also has headphones and several iTouch devices available for museum-goers to borrow. These technologies augment the museum experience by giving visitors individual control of a personal device that feeds them media relevant to the exhibets. The ICA also has a 'mediatheque' with monitors and videos that one could view, as well as several audio and video pieces that visitors can view or listen to, but not control or further interact with. However, using these mobile devices in the museum does not render them outside the scope of the wireless panopticon. How could museums design interactive, augmented spaces that would not contribute to this surveillance?

As stated above, the Institute for Contemporary Art had devices that one could borrow to access the augmented experience. Perhaps museums could obtain more of these and use them instead of visitors' personal devices? Or they could continue to develop the mediatheque, perhaps installing several more stations throughout the gallery.
