## Holocaust Museum Houston

The museum I chose to look at was the Holocaust Museum in Houston. I found the website quite successive in making itself an attractive institution for people to visit. Everything is neatly organized and has a lot of information on it that would get people interested in learning more about it. It is not only pretty straightforward to plan a visit and show how accessible it is to people of different backgrounds, but it is also has a library for students and researchers who are interested. There is also a place on the website where you can rent a venue or volunteer. Overall, the website seems to try its best to answer any questions someone visiting the website might have.
