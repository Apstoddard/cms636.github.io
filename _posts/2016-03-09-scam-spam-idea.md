title: Scam/Spam Idea
---

While looking through the spam messages, it struck me how despite the fictional narratives taking place in different places, fictional people being different nationalities, there were only a few types of structures: either it's a person who has a lot of money and needs help moving it, or it's someone offering free money that by some accident now belongs to you. These firm structures make it easy to gerenate content automatically, so I think it would be interesting to build a spam email generator - something that, when given a theme or a country, would generate a (more or less) unique heart-wrenching sob story. I'm really curious about whether it's possible to replicate the feeling of reading a spam email, or if there's some necessary human touch that the scammers are able to inject into their fake stories.
