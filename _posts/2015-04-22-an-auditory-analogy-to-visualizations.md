Sterne and Akiyama's piece on Sonification introduces interesting concepts as well as raises several key questions about the nature and purpose of sharing sounds. While reading this article, I found the interplay between the visual and sonic to be interesting, especially considering our focus on visualizations early in the semester. This article seems to argue that the sonifications produced generally have a more artistic purpose than the mere conveying of data. On the other hand, sonification projects which provided auditory data to hear-impaired people. I think both these applications provide interesting paths for future sound projects.

In considering our discussions of visualizations earlier in the semester, a key part of creating a visualization was determining what kind of questions the visualization attempted to answer. Thus, sonification could be seen as the auditory analogy to visualization. Yet the projects which "use data as the raw material for art do not appear to be sonifications in this sense but rather cultivated experience which could convey some broad concepts concerning the data, but do not seek a specific research question to answer.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, exist the projects focused on the hearing impaired. I believe that sonification has an important part in this realm, especially considering the visual bias present in most scientific study. Yet I do not believe the examples presented in this article reach this goal. Echolocation can be a powerful tool but I would not consider it a sonification in the sense that I described above.

I think the most interesting type of project which could be pursued is a sonification that encompasses the ideas of curation and exploration that visualizations present. By trying to answer a set of questions with a sonification, a valuable research tool which can present data in new ways as well as increase the accessibility of research tools to those who cannot use visualizations.

Concerning our research area, I think we are attempting to incorporate a type of signification. The ability to listen to knew audio as one moves around a physical space creates a sound experience, but I would worry that the visual would be necessary to complete the experience. Perhaps if there were an audio description of the surroundings, this could replace looking at the locations themselves.
