[Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) is an online library containing a vast trove of texts from the ancient Greco-Roman world and beyond. A project of [Tufts University](http://tufts.edu/) since the mid-1980s, Perseus has evolved into a web-based collection reaching from the classics into many other parts of the humanities, augmented by advanced research tools. You can browse and search the Perseus collections [here](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collections).
