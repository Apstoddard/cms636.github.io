**Readings response: Week 6** 

**Ai and the future of museums** 
Like many mentioned in their responses, I also recognized that I was biased throughout the course towards using AI to enhance audience engagement and experience rather than in the backend operations of the museum. I think there is a lot of value for museums there especially when it comes to cutting costs and managing intricate workflows. The article does a good job at highlighting all those avenues where a musuem can add value. 
 That being said, I think there is a certain expectation of museums, at least in my opinion, to push the boundaries of AI in their museum spaces. Especially when it comes to the more modern and contemporary technology museums. There should be some push towards exhibiting and experimenting with narrative-changing and speculative AI. 

**The shape of art history in the eyes of the machine** 
To address the question posed by the reading assignment, I think when it comes to stylistic classification I must agree that machine and art historian classification should ultimately align with the improvement of machine learning models. That being said, I am not an expert in machine learning but it would be wonderful if we could compare that key differentiating characteristics the model picks up and compare those to the differentiating characteristics that art historians use to classify paintings. Ultimately, we may discover that there is some more wiggle room when it comes to art historianâ€™s classification which is left up to the historian to decide. Some paintings truly do lie on the intersection of multiple eras and are up for interpretation. It would be interesting to do such a comparison to better answer this question.
