Ariana created our first prototype in App Inventor (which can now post text, images, and sound) and explored the SoundCloud API. Sherry led a review of Halsey’s Round: Cambridge app together to decide on what we liked and disliked. The most important take aways were to ask relevant and evocative questions and to always have some media for the user. So, we decided to have 3 large range sounds that always cover our area. To do this, we decided to narrow our focus to just the Berklee campus and Berklee college culture. So, we also explored the Berklee campus together to explore the ethnographics and to think of good questions. Meridian kept notes of our exploration and research (online from Berklee’s website to Soundcloud to FB’s Overheard at Berklee and in-person contacts).   Meridian also created some wireframes of the application and will continue to work on questions and starting media for the app.
