I find it interesting how Manovich is studying databases as a cultural phenomenom on the rise in new media. It is a different way to examine the form. I suppose in a way, it is a way of presenting information, just as a narrative may be another form. However, to say they're competing? With so many examples that he calls "exceptions"? I'd rather say that the exception is the norm--that narratives and databases complement one another as a form of expression. I recall one short story I read in high school: it was literally a shopping list. A database. The story, the narrative, was implied by the list; it was a novel way of expressing the standard old affair-with-secretary plot. I believe collections and lists all tell their own story. That's part of what digital humanities is about, as I see it. Seen like that, databases can be a pretty suitable medium for fostering certain narratives. In reply to the counterpoint that a randomly chosen list of elements can't make a narrative, I would say that it does make a narrative--just not a coherent one. Not all narratives make sense, so why should a database that makes no sense be obligated to foster a sensible narrative? And just because a narrative can't be seen in some databases does not mean that they are enemies; I disagree with that conclusion.

Or even...the database is not the cultural part. The part that's cultural is how the database is presented. For example, web pages show one way to present databases. Tables are one way. Maps are another. And the current cultural fad in new media is leaning towards node graphs--I see those visualizations on the rise as a symbol of "new" tech. I'm not sure if that's what Manovich considers in the realm of narrative--the symbol--but if so, then it's all the more reason for narratives and databases to need to work hand in hand. An underlying database can be found in most narratives. So in that sense, narratives foster databases.

I was rather confused by his introduction of the idea of the "algorithm" as the hidden underlying logic in games but not present in narratives...yet the narratives also incorporate uncovering of underlying logic? These ideas seemed rather incoherent, at least as I read it. I didn't see what point he was trying to make. Games and narratives both involve giving the player/reader an experience. Games, however, give the player agency and let the player take actions. (And then of course there's the hybrid, interactive narratives.) In abstract games like Tetris, there's no story, so it's questionable whether that purely interactive experience of playing can really be called a "narrative." It really depends how broadly you want to define narratives.
