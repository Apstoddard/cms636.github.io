title: The Chartjunk Debate

> "To the degree that the message is important and the information
contained in the message is sufficient, the fact that these charts are memorable is useful. When the message is important, but greater understanding is needed, however, these charts fail. When charts of this type are promoted as examples of the way data visualization for other purposes should be designed, they are harmful."

Summary:
Like all things, Holmes-style charts have a time and place. They are most effective when the data's message is straightforward and can be conveyed easily and memorably through illustration. But for more nuanced messages, displaying the data itself in a readable format, without illustrations, is often clearer.

Commentary:
I readily agree that visual embellishments, when tasteful and functional, can enhance the presentation of data. And I would also agree this does not classify as "chartjunk". But from my own experience, embellishmemts more often errs on the side of overdone rather than underdone. This is especially the case -- and often is the case -- when someone not trained/experienced as a graphic artist tries to make an embellished image. Since embellishments are in some ways an art form, I think people tend to consider it as a subjective work that anyone can do, when in reality, the vast majority of times it would be better to hire an actual graphic artist. 

> "When graphs are used in this more typical manner, they should exhibit the following characteristics:
> 1. Present all the data that is needed for the audience to see and understand what’s meaningful.
> 2. Present nothing that isn’t needed.
> 3. Represent data accurately.
> 4. Represent data in a way that is easy for the eyes to perceive and the brain to interpret.
> 5. Provide appropriate context for interpreting the meaning of the data"

> "Three factors in particular come to mind that should have been taken into account and controlled in this study:
• Characteristics of a representative sample of quantitative graph users
• Different purposes for which people use quantitative graphs
• Different types of chart embellishment
The study suffered from ignoring these factors, producing results that cannot be trusted, despite the fact that they are probably true, and cannot be used to evaluate the effects of chartjunk on most of the quantitative graphs that are used in the world."

Summary:
Graphs should express what is strictly necessary with context in a way that is accurate and aesthetic.

Commentary:
Of course, deeming what is necessary can be, at times, subjective. I got the sense that the author of this paper believes that every chart should have a clear (if multifaceted) message. But I think that if a chart can be explained in one sentence, why not just express its message in a sentence? Why have the chart at all? For example, for "the basic message that steelworkers are paid a lot more in the United States than
elsewhere, especially in South Korea" referenced in the article, I think the sentence does a better, more concise job of explaining the facts rather than the chart. Charts, while pretty and helpful for breaking up long texts, should be reserved for data that cannot easily be summed up in a sentence. Other illustrations can be used to add insightful visuals to a study.

> "By defining chartjunk too broadly, Tufte to some degree invited the heated controversy that has raged ever since. The fundamental issue is whether embellishments support the data or to some degree distract from it or distort it. Embellishments that represent data, even metaphorically, can themselves qualify as 'data ink.' Embellishments that are not data in themselves can sometimes support the display of data in a useful manner"

Summary:
The term "chartjunk" does not include embellishments that enhance a dataset.

Commentary:
Readily agree. While modern aesthetic favors the minimal, and I very much personally am in favor of the minimal art style, embellishments can help make data memorable. And as publications are often vying for the attention of the reader, being memorable is indeed perhaps one of the most difficult tasks of a researcher.
