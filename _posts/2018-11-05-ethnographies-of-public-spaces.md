### The MIT Museum


# Who?
We visited the MIT museum on Sunday morning. From our observations, most of the visitors were tourists. Some of them went to the museum as part of the experience of visiting MIT. There were also a lot of older adults and children visiting the museum, but we didn’t see many students while we were there.

# Technologies
**Projectors** were widely used for both exhibitions and ornamental display. Not a lot of people were watching the videos, so perhaps running them at an infinite loop is not the best way to display them. Maybe having some sort of “play” button would increase interaction.

Various **touch screens** were installed. Some of them were connected to other devices such as earphones, so it was an auditory and visual experience. Contents shown on the touch screens ranged from 3D models that allowed zooming-in/out, panning, rotating, interactive drawings, interactive infographics, surveys, and so on.Some screens appeared to be touch-screens but were actually not. Just a screen display with no context made it hard to tell.

**Interactive art installations** that sense proximity, sound, movement. It was a bit unclear how to interact with the art. A sign demonstrating or explaining how would be helpful, but also might might be too leading? It’s a fine line between allowing the viewer to engage with the art organically, and explaining what to do. Some art was positioned in a way that the visitors were forced to interact with them (such as the staircase leading to the second floor that senses movement and plays music). Some art could be triggered with **pedals**. In the “Gestural Engineering” exhibition almost all the artworks required viewers to either rotate some handle or step on some pedal to trigger the movement. For the beans installation, it was also a bit unclear whether you could touch and rotate the gear. Again, the fine line between organic engagement and the need for clearer signs indicating what you can and cannot touch came into play. Walls of visual displays were accompanied with **books** laid out on benches meant to supplement the brain exhibition.
  
  
# Unexpected uses
What we didn’t expect was to see many kids in the museum. We believe it is partially because most of the exhibitions had some interactive features, which are especially attractive to kids. Specifically, the “Beautiful Brain” exhibition contained a makerspace where the kids could make drawings of brain on a large table. It included some touchable models of the brain that were meant for blind people, but could be something playful for kids, as well.

# Frustrations and alienations
There were not many places to “hang out”, where one could sit or gather or quietly observe exhibits - it felt more like something you had to keep moving through since everything was meant for standing/walking. The layout of first floor space was particularly alienating, with most of the exhibits smushed in one corner, leaving a a very large empty space in the middle of the room with nothing in it. There is no clear direction or obvious flow of how one should move through the open space. The second floor, however, is clearer in this respect because it follows more of an enclosed pathway and there is a clear direction and progression. There is also a frustrating inconsistency in the placard displays - across the whole museum it seemed like there were constantly new forms/formats of placards appearing, which made the entire museum feel not cohesive. Sometimes, displays were not accompanied by a placard/description at all, leaving the viewer with no information about what they are looking at. These frustrations could probably be helped with just some minor additions in signage and placards that provide visitors with more information on exhibits and how to traverse the space.

# Relationship of the interior & exterior
The interior of the first floor meshes with the outdoors via large floor-to-ceiling windows that offer an abundance of daylight and clear view of the adjacent sidewalk. Likewise, passerbys outside can see into the museum, welcoming them in by allowing them to see inside and also by a happy yellow sign sporting “MIT Museum”. The location of the museum is on a busy local street very close to campus which also encourages visitors. The workers at the front desk are proactive and welcoming. Past them, leading to the second floor, an interactive staircase plays harmonious chimes with every step, engaging visitors immediately.
