We've worked on a few things since our last class update:
- Further developed and refined our design of the screen user interfaces: https://www.figma.com/proto/C6vcwS4k8eBScF1i8xSXNf/inFORM?node-id=3-32&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A32&show-proto-sidebar=1
- Coded web app for inFORM (open up tabs on different computers to simultaneously manipulate inFORM): https://inform.herokuapp.com/
- Developed new concepts of exhibiting inFORM: playing music, typing out a simple message, modeling a cityscape/landscape
