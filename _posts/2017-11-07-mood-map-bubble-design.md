This is the rough prototype I presented in class: https://invis.io/FXECMD4YE
The idea of the design is that users would click and hold on each circle, or perhaps a minimum of three, which will grow bigger, and words describing the levels of intensity will pop up one at a time above the circle, e.g. slightly, somewhat, definitely, very. The users would release the click when the description they want pops up, and the word and the size of the circle will stop changing. Once the user starts clicking, the text "All done? Tell us why" will appear under the existing title and a short instruction. Clicking on "Tell us why" which would be formatted as hyperlinked text, will take users to a second webpage with tags and keywords they can click on, to associate their moods with causes or events. There would be a done button on this second page to submit the data, and perhaps text will show up to confirm the submission. There would then be a link to return to the starting page, and if possible, the page would also redirect itself to the starting page after a short period of inactivity.
