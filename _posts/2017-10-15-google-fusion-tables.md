title: Google Fusion Tables

I had a bad time exploring mapbox and carto because I couldn't upload the database in right format. So I choose to use google fusion tables even though there are limited options to play with the data. 
When I first look at this data, I'm wondering which locations are mentioned in the conversation and which are they really experience physically? But I have no way to differentiate it unless I read the whole context. So it's impossible to draw curve lines to show the travel history. Then I look carefully at the excel sheet, I found in the Etymology row, "chapter 71" and "chapter 76" highlighted for some reason. Although I didn't understand the real context and main ideas of these chapters, I assumed they are two important time points and divided the locations into three parts based on chapters. I found the pop up column is useful because of the quotations. In the heat map, we can clearly see which part of the world are most frequently mentioned in this novel. I wish there could be more options to layer on the map.
