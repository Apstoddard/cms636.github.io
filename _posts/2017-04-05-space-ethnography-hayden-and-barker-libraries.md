title: 'Space Ethnography: Hayden and Barker Libraries'
author: Thatcher
---
I chose to examine two MIT libraries for the *Ethnographies of Public Spaces* project. The two different in their uses and atmospheres despite both being part of the same library system.

Barker Library is well isolated from commonly traveled routes around the Institute. Situated just beneath the Great Dome, one has to take stairs or and elevator up five levels to reach it. Barker is extremely quiet. It used mostly by students as a place to do work and is often completely full. Due to its open floor plan and high, domed ceiling, any sound made is very noticeable, so everyone in the library is very quiet. Little technology is found in the library, but nearly all students use laptops at tables in the space. 

Hayden library, on the other hand, is a bit less silent and studious. Besides studying, students are often found sleeping, meeting in a conference room, or using the many scanners and printers. The scanners are an excellent addition to the library space – any book or document can be easily scanned and saved to flash drive or emailed for later reading. Due to its more varied design, with two levels and several divided areas of desks, talking feel more permissible in Hayden Library than in Barker, so some people can be found talking in low voices as opposed to Barker’s complete silence. Hayden also has large windows overlooking the Charles River, inviting users of the space to sit and observe the river as well as look at books. Hayden is also more accessible, located on the ground floor of a building not too far from commonly-used academic buildings and dorms.

I forgot to take pictures of these space while I was observing them, but I invite the reader to visit these two libraries and see the differences between them.
