## A New Post

I’m honestly less sure now than I was before last week, as what everyone said in class was really intriguing. I’m definitely interested in the ideas of place-based or object-oriented memory that people discussed, which I think would both be useful for my own work but also totally new to me! I think it would be really fascinating to develop those ideas with a team. I also used to study Linguistics, so all of the ideas involving language caught my eye. In terms of my own work, I think both veins would be useful, so it’s hard to narrow it down in that sense. I'd be happy to think more about either as we narrow down further, but for now those are the two threads that appealed!
