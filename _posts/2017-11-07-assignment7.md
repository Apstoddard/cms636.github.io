##Curatorship as Social Practice
Curating has been tranformed by shifts in the relationship among people, objects, and society. The work then should focus on the dynamics of this relation instead of either objects or people. For instance, social media has become an important platform for people to gain information around them. The relation between people and data connected by social media is very unique. It is constantly changing and more lax than other conventional kinds of relation. For example, videos, photos, posts, articles and news are the common media where people come in contact with information. However, the rise of memes, digital media, and new social media sites will change the way people receive and perceive information. Since social media has already become an important platform for museum to reach out to their audience and engage them with educational content, it is worth investigate in how people deal with information they receive via social media. It is not necessary to follow the trends on social media to deliver informations. Curating can be inventive and creative about their ways of presenting educational content on this digital platform. 

##Introduction to Special Issue: Discursive Space
Though I like that the essays of this issue seek to challenge the idea of the museum as solely a home for scholarly discourse or storytelling, I do think fundamentally the museum is for storytelling. Telling/passing down stories is human nature and culture. Among these stories, it is likely that they will spark contentious debates, social issues, and creative ideas. However, the museum should distinguish itself from theater or movies which also tell stories. Museum be design has the space to interact with users directly and more liberty to craft an experience that they want users to get out. Literature, theater, and certain kinds of visual art like photography are confined to one or two medium to tell stories. The museum is not confined to one medium to narrate its stories. In fact, it can combine old media with new ones such as social media and digital media to craft their narratives. This liberty is a blessing but also a curse since now there are more parameter to think about and more planning/designing decisions to make even after crafting the stories. Given that the museum has such a broad range of media to deliver their content, I would not try to fit museum into a particular box by defining detailed purposes of the museum. Its overarching purpose should be broad enough that would allow various options to tell stories and create learning and effective experiences.
