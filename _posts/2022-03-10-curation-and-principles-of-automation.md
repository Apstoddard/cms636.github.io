## How are museums using artificial intelligence, and is AI the future of museums?"

I appreciate the reiteration, as was similarly mentioned by representatives of the Computer History Museum, that most of the last decade's utility of AI is with (now commonplace) technologies that are able to more rapidly automate only very narrow (and thus primitive) evaluation paradigms on large data sets. I am interested in deconstructing whether the Berenson AI was an appropriate processing of signals to perform sentiment analysis. Improvements to museum operations, such as capacity managment and simplified interfaces for visitors' discretional memento-making and navigation of the facility, appear as unequivocal benefits; and I especially agree that prospects of computationally aided curation and methods of augmented immersion are highly dependent on the objectives held by these hybrid human-machine decision-makers.
