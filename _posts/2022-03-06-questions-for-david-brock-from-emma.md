- Based on the results of this prototype, how do you think the Computing History Museum might use ML on its collections going forward? What application are you most hopeful or excited about?
- Do you think use of ML tools can be extended to other museums' collections? Are there limits (i.e. due to cost, requiring specialized skills or a certain kind of collection) to what kinds of museums might find it useful or feasible?
- Do you see these tools helping with exhibit design, or is it more aimed at assisting researchers? Is it challenging to balance research needs with exhibition needs in general, or do they complement each other?
- Are you thinking about near-term ways to mitigate the effects of AI bias on the generated metadata? Especially since women and people of color have often been written out of computing history, it could be valuable if AI could be used to help highlight their roles rather than accidentally omitting them further by misidentification.
- Are there any features you hope to add in future prototypes of these tools?
- Are there parts of the Computing History Museum collection that can't be easily analyzed with the current ML tools, that you wish you had some other technology for?
