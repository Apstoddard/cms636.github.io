title: Text Mining- Anna
---
For the text mining exercise, I spent some time looking at the canon of my favorite Russian poet, Anna Akhmatova, as well as that of Russia’s most favorite poet, Pushkin. I added Pushkin mostly due to the fact that we have a more concrete idea of what his canon entails, and with the Voyant tools, I was really interested in development of lexicon over time. It was clear for both poets how topics changed over time- for example, their use of “love” and “heart”:

Akhmatova

Although I was using these tools in a simple, exploratory way, I think they could still serve argumentative purposes. For example, scholarship on Akhmatova often (and in my opinion, incorrectly) posits that she was a “love poet” in her early writing and a “serious” poet in her later work. Using terms over time, such as the ones above, larger patterns are clear. Or, for example, illustrating her use of the word “muse” or “people” (as in ‘my people, the Russian people’) shows that she considered “serious” topics throughout her career:
