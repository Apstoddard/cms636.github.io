title: Digital Memory & The Archive
author: Sarah Aladetan

In _Temporality and the Multimedia Archive_, Ernst’s arguments and contemplations in _Underway to the Dual System_ and _Archives in Transition_ are introduced. It seems that both will discuss archiving of new digital media and the dynamics that stem from the inherent differences in digital vs. analog artistic works. In  _Underway to the Dual System_, I thought an interesting argument being made was the idea that an archive was on longer defined by it’s content but rather it’s connections and how the content is linked. I think this idea doesn’t necessarily work completely when you think about the ephemerality of web-based media and the whole purpose of Internet archives that we discussed this week.  Later in the chapter, they go to refer to the Internet as a “transarchive” and I believe this distinction allows their previous argument to breath. I thought the sentence “what makes the difference between a memory and an archive is an organized archive barrier” was very interesting. It was really interesting reading _Archives in Transition_ in a time where we’ve had high speed internet and streaming media for enough time that it’s ingrained in our society. While reading this section, I had to take a step back and recall a time when transmission media was non-existent or a novelty.
