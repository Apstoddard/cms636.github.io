I resonate with the correlation Evans makes between the “aha” moment and participation. As a non-artist museum audience, seldom do I go there knowing what to expect, and I constantly look forward to the interstitial space between my knowledge construct and what’s on in the museum. Not to further romanticize the “unexpected,” a quote I really like from Richard Rorty is that "Knowingness is a state of soul which prevents shudders of awe. It makes one immune to romantic enthusiasm." 

I find the “What is radical about the photographs in this exhibition” shares similar dynamics with some of the class’s project proposals, in terms of participation, interpretation, and control shift to participators.
