In this reading, the author posits museums and libraries as potential "third places" for people to congregate, socialize, and learn outside of school, work, or the home. For some wealthy city-goers, these third places look like coffee shops or bars. For poorer folks, this may look more like a laundromat. 

In my experience, growing up on the cusp of suburban and rural metro-Detroit, my third place actually was a library. Nestled in a strip mall, and later a larger industrial warehouse, the library was unassuming and inviting. As a child, I mowed through books, both in the children's and young adult sections and the adult sections as I grew older. Usually, I would go with my mom and leave soon after with a stack of books to read, but, once I got older, I began to get more involved, joining the youth advisory group, through which I volunteered for the library and helped to plan events. My hometown's library held many practical events for residents of the town, such as: book clubs, tax help sessions, computer literacy classes, children's puppet shows, youth reading challenges, craft nights, author visits, and even talks about our town's history from the town's hobbyist historicist. These practical, and usually free, events (tailored for residents' interests and age groups, and often designed and run by them), along with the library's normal services, made it a wonderful third place for community members of my town.

The closest art museum to my hometown of which I am aware is the Detroit Institute of Arts, located in downtown Detroit. While I love the museum, I am unsure if it is a suitable third place for residents. First, the fee to enter is prohibitive for many residents of the city. Second, it does not seem to have much community involvement in its curation. Third, it hosts only a few types of specialized events: art exhibits, musical events, and film screenings. Though I love the Detroit Institute of Arts, if one is not already accustomed to going to these types of events, or if one does not have the funds to attend, this museum makes a much less practical third space.

Overall, I think there are two key components that spaces must have to make a good third place for a community: relevance and accessibility. Relevance can be obtained easily through community input and involvement. Accessibility means setting low financial barriers to entry, along with other measures, such as wheelchair ramps and programming suited to community members (ie: children's programming or childcare).
