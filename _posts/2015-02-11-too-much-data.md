"Big Data" is the new buzzword in the tech space, and represents the explosive amounts of data we can observe from our surroundings and the applications that we can build from it. In terms of Digital Humanities, in the past, it is merely through subjective observation. Spoken words are quickly forgotten, and texts are merely patterns of ink on paper. 

But with the explosion of digital technologies and social media platforms, blog posts, tweets, photos, and even friends can be stored and analyzed. Digital texts become multidimensional and can be used to explore social phenomena. Humanities is no longer subject to the researcher's biases, but can be computed. 

We are now able to quantify what's around us, and hence digital humanities is born. With so much data out there, how can we mine out what we want and recreate it to communicate our message? The reading this week really highlighted the potential of digital humanities in this age of data.
