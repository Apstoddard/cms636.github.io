I liked Baccaglini's paper. I think it reinforces a lot of the same ideas we've been looking at in this class - the shift from serving the aristocracy to the general public, proper context for materials, and a shift from collection to outreach. 

I liked her emphasis on storytelling+narrative a as means for public engagement. And, I liked her section on the importance of giving context for different material (and not just blankly presenting a painting or ancient pot). However, I wished that she had made more of an explicit linkage between [a] narrative and [b] providing proper context. I think the most effective narrative building happens when it is between groups that may not get to talk on the daily. And if these two groups do not have a shared understanding of each other, their traditions or norms could be misinterpreted or misrepresented. I think there should be more focus on properly framing people's stories, especially when it is from marginalized or previously misrepresented communities.
