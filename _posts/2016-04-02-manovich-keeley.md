## The Interplay Between Reductionism and Ornate Augmentation

Manovich's, _The poetics of augmented space_, presented a very interesting dichotomy between a modernist desire for reductionism, and our desire for an ever more comprehensive, ubiquitous amount of information. It is interesting to consider our desire for both minimimalism, and having all information available immediately at our fingertips. The most modern of current cities display an interesting mix of intense sensory information, with lights, sounds, and images, and minimilistic architecture, with stainless steel, glass and concrete.

I am curious to see in which direction architectural design goes, and what balanace is achieved between data overlay, and a relief from information overload.
