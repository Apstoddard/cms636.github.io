## Project concept 
We aim to introduce a national museum wide pass that enables easy access to a multitude of museums across the United States. The pass would be coupled with a data collection layer that allows museums to better understand users across different data categories, enhance marketing, curation and visitor experience efforts in a cohesive manner. 

## Key pain points
Absence of a centralized journal or platform for user-generated notes & collections 
Complex/convoluted user journey to get a NARM pass currently 
Limited cross-institutional data collection 

## Product plan
- UI/UX redesign to NARM membership website 
- UI/UX design of centralized user journal 
- Data architecture


## Audience & collaborator
Our audience is made up of current and future NARM members; however, we do envision this solution to be expandable to other museums beyond the NARM and the US. The key collaborator in our project would be narm. 

## Tech approach
	Our project will rely on UI/UX interactions designed in Figma and we will develop the data architecture system as a graphic. If time permits, we could demonstrate a case study of a data set (based on availability).
