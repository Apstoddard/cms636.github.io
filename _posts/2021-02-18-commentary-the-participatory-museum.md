Nina Simon is a talented and passionate activist who is trying to transform museums so that they are not only places that you go to visit but where you go to actively participate and connect with each other. In both her preface and TED Talk, she stresses the need to change the way people view museums. To encourage people to stop thinking of museums as preppy institutions and instead start thinking of them as places to connect, discuss and build a community. In her TED talk, Simon points out that we live in an incredibly creative fertile time where people go to bars to knit together or gather in a room to perform science experiments. Not very far from Boston we can clearly see similar examples such as the Artisan's Asylum in Sommerville, MA: a non-profit makerspace devoted to the teaching, learning and practice of fabrication. However, the road that we all need to take to open museums and make them more accessible is not easy.
 
In her preface, Simon asks herself what would be the best way for museums to reconnect with the public and demonstrate their value and relevance in todayâ€™s world. Her answer is to do as much as possible to encourage interaction between the exhibit and people but also between members of the public. It might take some time for people to get used to participatory learning but if museums give them the tools to communicate and make the public feel that what they say matters, people would not be afraid of speaking up and share this learning experience with one another. It will transform cultural institutions, and by doing so it could potentially also transform a whole community, especially regarding the youth.
