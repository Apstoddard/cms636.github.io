## A New Post

Our project aims to make the archives of La Comedie-Francaise more accessible to researchers and academic people. Since reading the original documents present several challenges ranging from a language barrier to the unclarity of the writing and the general composition, our approach is based on several steps leading to the transfer of these facsimile to the digital world. 

First the original documents would pass by a platform that would convert handwritten text into digital text to be stored online (on servers or cloud). In order to have it accessible to  researchers from different background, these texts would pass by a translation tool. 

The final interface would be a website including the original document and a schematic plan corresponding to the era of the document. Our research shows, the company played in several theater depending on each period of time (ie :Théâtre de la République,Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier, Studio-Théâtre). When someone hovers over a section of the original document, the corresponding section in the theatre would light up while showing the price and the complementary services that come with that type of seating. 

We envision that this tool would facilitate the research work conducted by academics by making it easily accessible and by providing them with an estimate of the ticket prices and benefits done by the Comedie-Francaise within a certain time period. Moreover it would give a general sensibility about the popularity of La Comedie francaise and thus by tracking how many seats were reserved by night.
