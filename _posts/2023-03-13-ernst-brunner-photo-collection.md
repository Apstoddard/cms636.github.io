The landing page was simple, and the collections were placed in the epicenter of the page. I also like that each photograph has a zoomer tool that preserves the quality of the object upon zooming in, can also be rotated, and that switching between them is simple. However, every time I click on another collection, I change the language to English in the hopes that the description will change, but the labels remain in German nonetheless. I felt dissociated from the experience, and I am not sure if that was a result of the language barrier. It felt as if I were scrolling through albums without knowing anything about the background, the curator, the history, or the story behind the collection. While a photo is in and of itself a storyteller, the label in various languages will ensure contextualizing the work and engage the viewer. I think the label will provide multiple layers of data "Plurality" as the critical design workflow text describes it.
