## Initial Thoughts

**1. Whole Earth Archive**
A website that would provide a comprehensive look into the contents of the [Whole Earth Catalog](http://www.wholeearth.com/index.php), as it is not working online. The site sketch could also include user profiles so they could remix the content

**2a. Freedom Trail AR**
A supplemental app for the [Freedom Trail](http://www.thefreedomtrail.org/) that would augment the tour with additional information, particularly focusing on communities whose voices are otherwise invisible on that tourist journey. 

**2b. Freedom Trail Site**
An archival site for the monuments in the Freedom Trail. This would try to use 3D rendering of the monuments, exploring  digitizing methods other than photo documentation. 

**3. Making Invisible Visible App**
An app that would reveal things that would be invisible. E.g. microorganisms in the air around us, pollutants, pollen, etc. 

**4. Sackner Archive of Concrete Poetry**
A redesign of the [Sackner Archive of Concrete Poetry](http://ww3.rediscov.com/sacknerarchives/), that would provide a more user-friendly exploration of their content and teaching tools for digitizing concrete poetry.
