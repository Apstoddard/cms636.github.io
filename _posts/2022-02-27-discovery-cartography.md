- A working title
    - Discovery Cartography
    
- A description of the issue/problem that you are trying to address;
    - This is a framework for mapping human exploration patterns through data. I want to create a web platform for guests to explore content. However, as they explore, they will be creating a map of the content they explore in realtime similar to the photo below. The idea is to encourage guests to build a picture of what they explore and see how other people engaged with the content as well.

- The envisioned audience for your project;
    - Anyone! This will work best for people without vision impairment.
    
- Potential museum collaborators (currently MFA, MIT-Museum, Getty, Carnegie Mellon, Computer
History Museum, and others are possible as well);
    - Any collaborator with digitized data. I think it could be cool to add as a layer to current static HTML pages (like a window in the bottom corner).
    
- The technological approach (if part of the project)
    - Use Javascript libraries to create a web implementation of this discovery mapping
    
- Skill sets needed for your project.
    - Web developers, data scientists, graphic designers
