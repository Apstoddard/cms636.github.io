## ICA digital app

The ICA digital guide app offers a seamless and user-friendly experience for visitors, making it easy for them to navigate the museum and its exhibitions. The app's clean interface and intuitive design make it accessible to users of all levels of technological proficiency. With the app, visitors can effortlessly access information about the museum's exhibitions, including timelines, themes, and key artworks. The app also provides essential practical details such as exhibition durations and locations, allowing users to plan their visit more efficiently. The lookup feature in the app is particularly helpful for visitors seeking more in-depth information about specific artworks. By entering the artwork's number, users can access detailed descriptions and easily save screenshots for later reference. In addition to helping with navigation within the museum, the app also assists users with transportation and parking information, making the overall museum experience more convenient and enjoyable.

One of the standout features of the ICA digital guide app is the inclusion of multimedia content, such as videos and audio recordings. The walkthrough video of the Simone Leigh exhibition, for example, provides an immersive experience for users who cannot visit the museum in person. Furthermore, the audio welcome message from the director adds a personal touch, making visitors feel genuinely welcomed and appreciated.
