I really enjoyed this reading, I share a lot of the author’s thoughts on technology being a seductive complement or add-on to the visitor experience. The mistake of designing around a technology is over-done in the design world in general, this reading highlights how that can happen in the musuem. I believe design should always be centered around the question of user need first, never technology first; in doing that we do not loose sight of what is important. Having that perspective allows designers & curators to tell stories with the most “appropriate” medium, as every story has different narrative that can be told through different means. Once the story is clearly identified, designers can iterate on the best method to bring it forward.
