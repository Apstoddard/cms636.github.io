In the readings, the impression I got from the, was that it is beneficial to the museums to be able to make the plasters since it allows many other people to see it, which is true. The recasting of objects seems to become increasingly futuristic in the sense that technology such as apps can be used to see what the original object could have looked like. While this is impressive, I felt like it may lose the original first impression of the object, such as how art loses color over time, and not give the same feelings as they orignally did. While it certainly helps the audience visualize the buildings, what they visualize in their minds may not at all what was intended, which may be good or bad.
