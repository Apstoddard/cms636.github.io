## Olympic ArtMap Project Update, 4/26/17

**Content**

- Ece and Miles have been working on supplementary metadata. We now have columns to designate artists as famous/non-famous, to link images to submission data via URLs, and to associate artworks with the city they were submitted from. These are in varying degrees of completion--we'll continue to fill out the information over the next week.

- Miles and Yuchuan have been working on the landing page and "Intro"/"Demo" content. The first page of the site will give the user some basic information and illustrations concerning the art competitions. An "Intro" page will guide the user through the Mapping app while taking her through 5 representative artworks: generally covering different Olympic years, art-forms, styles, and contextual stories. Miles has selected the artworks and written the background paragraphs; Yuchuan has come up with designs for the landing and intro pages.

**Design**

- Yuchuan has designed a prototype version of the filter categories and buttons for the main ArtMap app. (Yuchuan: Yeah, for the landing page, I tried to combine text with images to provide attractions for people to read, just a very short intro for the art competition. And when they click the "to go" button, they will see the mapping page. We tried to use five colors, same as Olympic, since it is an odd number, I tried to layout them more in a free way, and the lines shows some links between each category and indicate there maybe some overlapped information.)

- Thatcher created the frames for the site layout.

**Coding**

- Kelsey used MySQL and PHP to import the three database files needed for the website

- Thatcher: I made a simple version of the web page we talked about last week. Right now it displays a map and draws arrows based on art and artist data. I formatted a small amount of test data by hand because we haven't integrated the database yet, but my hand-entered data is close to the same structure as the entries in the database, so integration should be very approachable.
