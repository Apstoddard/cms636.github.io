## Olympic ArtMap Project Update, 4/26/17

**Content**

- Ece and Miles have been working on supplementary metadata. We now have columns to designate artists as famous/non-famous, to link images to submission data via URLs, and to associate artworks with the city they were submitted from. These are in varying degrees of completion--we'll continue to fill out the information over the next week.

- Miles and Yuchuan have been working on the landing page and "Intro"/"Demo" content. The first page of the site will give the user some basic information and illustrations concerning the art competitions. An "Intro" page will guide the user through the Mapping app while taking her through 5 representative artworks: generally covering different Olympic years, art-forms, styles, and contextual stories. Miles has selected the artworks and written the background paragraphs; Yuchuan has come up with designs for the landing and intro pages.

**Design**

- Yuchuan has designed a prototype version of the filter categories and buttons for the main ArtMap app.
