I didn’t attend the exhibition, so I won’t be commenting on it here.

Lev Manovich’s text touched on a number of subjects related to augmented space. I enjoyed the article, and though it was well structured though it occasionally seemed disconnected. I though at times it seemed disconnected.

It was interesting thinking about the topics he brings up in relation to the research paradigms he presents early on. Context aware computing in particular seems to dominate his thinking about augmented space and how it represents another dimension to life. I think that the distinction between customizable data, like cellphones, and public displays is has gotten blurred with time. However, Venturi’s concept of architecture as iconography and the example of Catholic cathedrals that Manovich brings up made me wonder about how I look at public spaces like Times Square and how the architecture without the screens, changes my impression of what is shown.

I am also curious about the relationship of this technological layer to the economy, which Manovich only hints at here and there in the article. I think that the economic value of this is an important consideration. External factors must align to realize the promise of everything that Manovich talks about, from art to branscaping. For example, as he mentions, the wonder of the internet fell victim to economics in the 1990s, and exhibits like The Enemy are not free for a reason.

The second reading focuses more on the response of consumers to Manovich’s augmented reality, specifically in the art space. Exhibits like the MicroTile Collection Wall in Gallery One attempt to transmit data to draw in consumers. With the wall, the gallery creators attempted to simultaneously condense and expand information to provide another layer of understanding in 3-D space. When we think about museum vistors who average at 6 minutes per exhibit, we want to keep up with the times while architectural integrity- i.e., creating a iconographic and structurally appealing exhibit.
