**Idea 1 Improvement**
It is a theme focused project. I recalled the day when I was in the world trade center looking at the scared faces of people, also Ross showed how Jewish people suffered from genocide. I would like to do a collection,which could be a congregated source, of how people suffer from **disasters whether natural or human made one**. Previously, I have mentioned several branches like people’s reaction, international reaction and how city is transformed before and after. Now I would like to focus on one point, on **people’s reaction**. Maybe the refugees and the international voices. We may put them together to compare. You could then zoom in to a specific country to see. 


Approach: It could be timeline based or space based, for the past disasters, we could look for old newspapers to grab information. For the most recent ones which maybe easier to do, we could use the platform of Facebook or twitter to filter keywords. 

There are a lot of cases done by grabbing information by python and it could be used in our project. If there could be very brief people’s talk video, it would be better. In addition, there should be an overall map first, then zoom in , then rolling images and also hypertext for these images. 


**idea 2:**
It is called **searching history visualization**.
I was inspired by my using difficulties of google search history and a website that is introduced as follows.
While using the specific website( I forget the name and will upload as long as I found it) , there is an example but I could not find it now but will upload as long as I find it. It records the key words from what you have searched and shown on the interface, while you close one window, it is recorded. The more frequently you search the bigger it is.

Images could be another way to help record. Image is always more direct than a long name link and may leave a more strong impression on us. 

Since the difference of sources of information, it depends on each kind of source with a specific format. A specific sequence of information could help a lot while filtering information and records.

Approach: Design a useful format for each kind of source and try to use programming to filter different sources into each category. The most frequently clicked ones could also be recorded and shown bigger in your searching history.

Needs: Design an interface and also choose a proper platform to take practice. A specific one like library system maybe better than the general searching system Google.
