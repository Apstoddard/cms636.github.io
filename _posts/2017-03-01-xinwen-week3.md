The user interface of this java tool is simple and clean. The time line mapping is clear as well.  However, there are still few things that I would change if Iâ€™m responsible to redesign it. 

1. Sometimes the timeline itself is not evident and telling enough. It could be better if more attribute and statistics of the timeline could be added, such as the event density.

2. It wound be better if other reference could be add and cross-examined together with the main time line. Or this could be solved if we can create several timeline as the same time.
