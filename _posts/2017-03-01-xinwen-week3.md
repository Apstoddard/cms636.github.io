I started with basic timeline as the link below shown. And I found too much information is involved. When the information flooded, it is very hard to get anything.

Then my focus lied into the bottom sector of this graph. The density of event really draw my attention. I started to thinking about what could possibly be the reason of the difference in density. Then I draw other reference into conversation, such as the president of two country and the secretary of state.

comments on the timeline tool

The user interface of this java tool is simple and clean. The time line mapping is clear as well.  However, there are still few things that I would change if Iâ€™m responsible to redesign it. 

1. Sometimes the timeline itself is not evident and telling enough. It could be better if more attribute and statistics of the timeline could be added, such as the event density.

2. It wound be better if other reference could be add and cross-examined together with the main time line. Or this could be solved if we can create several timeline as the same time.
