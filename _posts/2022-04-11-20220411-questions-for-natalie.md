  -  Do you work directly with the artists whose work you are exhibiting? How (much) do you incorporate their vision of their work into the constraints of the space/budget/institutional vibe?
  -  How do you contextualize an artists' work? What thought process goes into the spatiality of a physical display for a work?
  -  Harrison's exhibit _Robota_ has many intracacies in meanings and is very intentional with all aspects of design - how does the curator convey this to the audience (especially if there are limits on text displays, whether it's how much people read or the physical space constraints)?
  - How do you think about each medium differently (eg structures vs photography, audio vs video) and how do  you incorporate different aspects to more fully engage the audience?
