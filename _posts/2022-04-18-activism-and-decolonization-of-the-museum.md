title: Activism and Decolonization of the Museum
author: Emma Batson
---
I found "The Past is Now" exhibit to be a thoughtful and rich case study on museum activism, one that draws on a lot of theory about activism more broadly too. Of course in some sense it seems to have succeeded at its goals: with a democratic process that brought in activists from the community, they crafted an exhibition that highlighted the importance of diverse voices and perspectives and was genuinely moving to people who saw themselves reflected in it. On the other hand, the process was difficult for those involved. The "insider activists" felt they had to do difficult emotional work and compromise their values to try to achieve success. The "outsider activists" felt that, despite the museum's attempt to democratize the process, they were still patronized and had to deal with the colonial-influenced structures of the museum system itself.

These issues and challenges of insider and outsider activists are, I think, not particular to the museum context -- any historical activist movement has similar stories. Still, as with other movements, it raises a hard question: can the museum be reformed or should it be replaced to cut ties with the harms of its historical past? I think the authors of the paper would agree that the most basic premises of museums -- collection, storytelling, education -- are worthy, even if the current institutions are flawed. But I wonder, if they could wake up and have the "ideal decolonized museum" tomorrow, what would it look like? Or should these ideas be pursued in an entirely different fashion?
