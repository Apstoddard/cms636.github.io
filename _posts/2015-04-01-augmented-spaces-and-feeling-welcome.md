As much as any of us have strong feelings about Manovich's last reading, this one seems fairly grounded to me. At least in his analysis of different augmented spaces, the ideas make sense even if the delivery is a bit flowery. I'd like to talk about the ideas he mentioned in the architecture-focused section of the article. He speaks about a Prada store that not only is an attractive space but also uses screens and imagery next to the products to make patrons want to buy the products. The space is augmented with a specific goal in mind: remind people why they want to buy Prada, and then sell them those items. 

After my particularly unwelcoming experience at the Fogg museum yesterday, I'd like to think that space could be augmented with the goal of welcoming patrons. A museum should be, in my mind, a place to enjoy or experience works of art in a reasonably relaxed manner. Obviously, if an installation is purpose-built to produce negative feelings, that's another matter, but in the case of sculputre and paintings a museum should provide a place where one can comfortably enjoy the art. However, the Fogg museum is built to be very modern-looking, with white walls and museum staff that follow you around like you're planning to kill the president. I think the space could be augmented to allow patrons to have an enjoyable experience while still protecting the museum's interests of safeguarding the art. 

A space could be augmented with screens, which direct patrons through the museum. if they used a mobile app to suggest which galleries they wanted to go see, a lighted floor covered in LEDs could provide individuals with a path through the museum. The same LED floor could warn visitors when they get too close to a museum piece by turning red, so that the museum staff don't need to stand in a corner and stare at patrons to ensure they don't touch art. Not that necessarily a floor turning red would feel welcoming, but I would feel less threatened by a technology being there to warn me if I do something wrong, rather than a human being who makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong just by being in the room.

These are just some small thoughts, but I liked the idea of augmented space through the architecture of the space itself. The Fogg museum really made me wish for an augmented space that removed the need for museum staff watching me all the time. It would be a more welcoming, enjoyable museum experience.
