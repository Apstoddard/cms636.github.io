“Cyber-Animism and Augmented dreams” and “Where stones can speak” 

I found Tamiko’s first reading eye-opening. I was unaware of the prevalence of the technology since the 1980’s. It made me wonder about the real potential that the metaverse has today. At least beyond gaming, the metaverse has no real use case for people around the world. We could argue that Covid precautions may be one but this will hopefully not be a long term issue. It remains a fact that the online experience is hardly similar to the in-person one.  Sometimes trying to create a use case around a technology is not the best path forward. Interestingly enough, the use case for AR for activism is really compelling. It works to fulfill the need to not be in the space as to risk one’s safety. 

The second reading, “Where stones can speak”, another interesting perspective was presented. Tamiko explains how she showcases worlds were reality is altered in a way that is illogical to provoke certain sensations for the viewer. Whenever I think about virtual reality I assume it will just be a reflection of our world or the creation or a new world that is better than ours. It was powerful to begin to think of users as characters in the story that participate in the dialog of the site. When applying these principles in the musuem context, we can imagine a world were way finding within this virtual world can be used an educational method to improve information retention in users.
