The idea of community driven curation is interesting. I believe we touched on this idea in our discussion of the _Moby Dick_ project and the merits of open source work. In the sense of a digital archive pertaining to a specific book, I am not sure of the correct application, but I think it is a powerful idea concerning museums. I especially enjoyed the example provided in the report on the _Wing Luke Asian Museum_. Giving community members the power to tell their own stories allows the community to choose how it is displayed, preventing narratives from being misrepresented or misunderstood. At the same time, museum staff provided technical expertise to help guide participants, thus maintaining the communicative and accesible qualities of museums. 

In order to further illustrate this I thought back to my experiences at museums. Growing up in the DC area meant that I visited the many large museums with extensive collections. These exhibits were large and well displayed. Further information on the topic was readily available from many sources. I also visited tiny museums that were solely focuses on a single topic. These were generally run by people intimitely familiar with the topic. While they did not have as much to display and the arrangement of the items was less intuitive, the people running these exhibits were a wealth of information and highly invested in what they displayed. These two notions represent the extremes of community verse professional curation.

Returning to the report, combining the knowledge and investment of people close to the narrative with the professional expertise of museum staff and curators will create informative exhibits that accurately display the ideas being presented. The report also mentions training more curators from varied backgrounds to help alleviate bais, but utilizing input from members of an existing community can also help.
