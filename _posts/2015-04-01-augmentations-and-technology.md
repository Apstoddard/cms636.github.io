Human computer interface is definitely a really cool field that is expanding rapidly today. I like the idea of augmenting physical spaces in addition to exploring the power of the virtual world. Manovich talks about a lot of different uses of technology to the end of affecting physical spaces, but I find the topic of the connected surveillance and augmentation to be a particularly interesting one. It is always a bit of a risky topic—people don’t like the idea of technology invading privacy (see 1984 and Google), yet they want technology to do a lot for them. But I definitely can see the merit in using that connection to delivery personal experiences. After all, museums are about delivering that experience to the user. So how can you tailor that? How can you make the person walk in and think: Wow, that’s just what I wanted to see. That’s what I wanted to feel. I imagine a possible augmentation of the space could be something like changing wall colors based on audience to affect the ambience of a room, or even creating a personal exhibit room.

The location-based software is also an extremely powerful tool, but I haven’t yet seen such apps doing room-based location yet. It’s mainly for streets. Could we not take that a level further in supportive buildings? Like, being able accurately to tell where in the blueprint of a building you are, or even the exact spot you’re standing? Information in the app based on the room you’re in? It’s definitely possible, and I think it would be really useful and interesting to consider the interactions.
