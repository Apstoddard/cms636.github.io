I found out that while the Fusion Tables was a bit limiting, the Google Maps Javascript API allowed much more freedom in implementing different ways to interact with the map and display different types of information. The overlay feature specifically was really interesting, as it allowed the user to visualize the same map created with modern technology along with a historical map, which allowed for a temporal representation to accompany the spacial aspect of maps. This gave the data an extra dimension that would otherwise not be there.
