title: Rethinking Virtual Spaces
category: updates
---

Virtual spaces diminish the importance of physical space. This is a perspective that has consumed the construction of information and services. With virtual spaces questions of privacy are raised. Virtual spaces can be ambigous and features can be hidden. We are constantly under surveilance and a majority of people are unaware. Our usage and data is also being tracked unknowingly. We are creating big data in the virtual spaces we navigate. We are creating value for big business. Our behavior is tracked by the virtual spaces we navigate on a daily basis, colelcted, and translated into meaninful data. We are not always aware of such activities. 

Is our current society equipped to navigate virtual spaces? Are all age demographics capable of processing such data layered and virtually represented information? How are virtual spaces currated to maximize delivery of information and simplicity? I greatly believe the interface is the determinant. I am passionate about revamping spaces and information in a virtual manner. Our methods of teaching are archaic, lecturing is far too antiquated and we live in a world where information is still highly text centered. Newer generations are growing up with a world of mixed mediums, but traditional school systems are not maximizing opportunities to represent information in varying methods.
