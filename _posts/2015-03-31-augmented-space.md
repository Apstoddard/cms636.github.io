title: Rethinking Virtual Spaces
category: updates

Virtual spaces diminish the importance of physical space. This is a perspective that has consumed the construction of information and services. With virtual spaces questions of privacy are raised. Virtual spaces can be ambigous and features can be hidden. We are constantly under surveilance and a majority of people are unaware. Our usage and data is also being tracked unknowingly. We are creating big data in the virtual spaces we navigate. We are creating value for big business. Our behavior is tracked by the virtual spaces we navigate on a daily basis, colelcted, and translated into meaninful data. We are not always aware of such activities. 

Is our current society equipped to navigate virtual spaces? Are all age demographics capable of processing such data layered and virtually represented information? How are virtual spaces currated to maximize delivery of information and simplicity? I greatly believe the interface is the determinant. I am passionate about revamping spaces and information in a virtual manner. Our methods of teaching are archaic, lecturing is far too antiquated and we live in a world where information is still highly text centered. Newer generations are growing up with a world of mixed mediums, but traditional school systems are not maximizing opportunities to represent information in varying methods. We are facing a transition from a highly text centered society to one that could be called highly pictoral visual. As a discussed in my museum visit post, I was a bit dissapointed with the way information was represented and displayed. I did not absorb the content like I could've. It was all text-centered, there were not no visuals, nor were there digital representations of the information. In thinking about augmented reality, I am reverted to oculas rift, which I currently see as the highest form of augmented reality. Could such emerging technologies replace a museum visit? Could I simply select MFA and turn the space into my bedroom to a virtual representation of the MFA. Would museums allow information to be represented in such a manner?
