## Assignment 3

[Assignment 3 - Iran & US Timeline](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1DPZe1AdcBr4M5ddweVfFzST9pkXQum03Gov8PY4mXHY&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650)

When surveying the multitude of events in the given data files describing US-Iran relations, we decided to hone in on curating a basic timeline of events focusing in on the proliferation of Iran’s nuclear program, the U.S. Administration’s reaction, and related international events. We selected to highlight the years between George W. Bush’s presidency and the election of Barack Obama. Using timeline.js, we compiled compelling photos to match the desired data points and created an interactive timeline for about 25 prevalent events that could be used in educational settings.
