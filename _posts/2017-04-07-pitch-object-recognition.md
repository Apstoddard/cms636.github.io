Problem: 
	I first came up with the idea for this project while working on the "Maurais" project for this class. For that project I was trying to go through a bunch of photos and find the ones that had people in it. I only had to go through approximately 300 photos and it took a while so I can only imagine how much time it takes for someone like a curator to go through a lot more than that. Therefore, I think it would be cool so somehow find a way to use object recogntion which can sort the photos itself and pick out the ones you need based on what you're looking for. 

Approach:

Object recognition is widely known in today's world and used a lot. Therefore, I would imagine the implementation itself would not be so complicated. 

I think it would be best however, not to have this be a project of its own but rather to implement this idea into someone else's project where it could be put to good use. If you want an idea of how object recognition works then the link below shows a good representationt of it:

Skills Needed:
-software 
-when implemented into an actual project then skills such as design, organization, and creativity will be needed
