In thinking about participatory classroom I am reverted back to my time in public high school. I believe that bringing elements of new media could encourage students to participate more. While in high school I realized that it is very easy to go unoticed. In classrooms that almost always had over 30 students, and teachers teaching 4 or more of these classes, you can just become another number. It a public school setting it takes masterful teaching to engage all students and make them participate. There were few classes where teachers managed to incite all students. It mostly came from self motivation. I believe that bringing technology into classrooms as early as preschool classrooms could enhance the learning and classroom experience. One example of this is social robots. I don't think social robots should replace teachers, but they could be a great asset to overwhelmed students. Social robots could work one on one with students to work at their individual strengths and weaknesses with the overall classroom strucutre provided by the teacher, school, district, county, and state.
