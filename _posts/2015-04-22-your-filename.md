In thinking about data sonification I analyzed how sound could produce more meaninful stories that traditional visual visualizations. Sound is layered, visual representations are limited by three dimensions, audio is much deeper, it can empower senses in an incredibly layered mannered. Narrative is incredibly powerful and with my past experiences sound produces a more stimulating, powerful, direct narrative. Living in a world that largely text based and growing increasingly grounded in visualizations it is important to not neglect the power of sound. Sound has the ability to empower the brain in ways that visual materials cannot. Sound can incite and alter consioucness by creating brain waves. Sonification can help individuals more easily  identify patterns in data. Our ears are acute and aware of changes in frequency. 

I think it is also important to question representation of data. Is data manipulated more with auditory or visual representations? Which median tells a truer, more representative story. I also believe it isn't necessary to exclude one form of visualization as supreme, combining auditory and visual data can lead to an all around bigger picture and effect. I found a sonification that relied on visual materials. If I were to of have heard the sonification on it's own I would of have been confused. Having the visual material to rely on was very important and powerful in my understanding of the data story. The writing of this sound was greatly intriguing, but ultimately relied on mapping numbers to peaks and lows in relation to pitch.

"Writing Sound"

Sonification-transformation of nonsonic data into audible sound
	way of visualization 
    
    Telling meaningful stories with data. 

Plasticity of Sound
	what can be heard?

Postsonic relationship?
	reproduction vs creation of sound?

Transforming sound into images

Convey data over various sensory registers 

Articulation Theory
	-sonification articulates a range of practices that render data for the ear
    -today articulations between particular senses and kinds of data is v weak.

Modularity of sensorary technology

Modularity of senses themselves 

isomorphically 

sound is powerful-more easily recognize patterns and absorb information 
	rendering data sensible
   	real insight into physical/informational processes; immediate relevance 
    
Accesibility (those who are blind)
	vision need not be priveldged
