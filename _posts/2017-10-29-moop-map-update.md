## Visualization
Start from http://msbarry.github.io/threejs-tool-page/scatterplot.html and modify to add interactivity and make more visually appealing.
For interactivity: https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui (example: http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/08/14/dat-gui-simple-ui-for-demos/) to allow the user to toggle visualization options e.g. filtering by specific tags. 
On how to use color in the visualization: probably k-means clustering or similar method to color the clusters. Useful reference material: https://github.com/kylemcdonald/Coloring-t-SNE

Alternatively: we found something very close to what we want to make that uses three.js: https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ai/drum-machine/view/ source code: https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-drum-machine but it looks a lot more difficult to understand how to use. We will try to get technical help.
