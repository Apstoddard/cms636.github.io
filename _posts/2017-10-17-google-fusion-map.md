Google Fusion Map is limited and can be improved. I used the filtering feature to pinpoint locations on the map. I also looked at the unmappable points to see what they are exactly. I explored heatmap and saw that some points were more detectable in heatmap. I find the heat map visually helpful and generally informative. It briefly gives the audience a sense of prevalence of the data over the world.
