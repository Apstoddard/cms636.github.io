In thinking about collection-building and curation I began to think of museumification. Offering the comparison of curation to human learning proves incredibly interesting to me. It reverts me back to the 18th century where the purpose of art was transformed to a more educational purpose. Building and displaying a collection of art for the public, rather than creating art for the nobility. Additionally, the statement regarding the relationship between original and copies was compelling to me. I continued thinking about old masters, originality and accessibility to art. Prints and digital version lose a great deal of authenticity and are far from reputable. Whereas with other forms of media having a copy is not highly thought about or disregarded. For example downloading a digital copy of a silent film from the early 1900s is not seen as viewing a copy, although one may be watching in a manner in which it was not intended to be viewed by the original creator and not on the original 35mm film, it is seen as equal to a large part of the population. Which raises a broader question, the accessibility and ease at which the average individual has access to a wide range of "media artifacts" today is amazing. This accessibility is a product of modern day curators. The reading discussed the scale and scope of these digitized "collections." It is amazing considering that the internet has only been around since 1990s.
