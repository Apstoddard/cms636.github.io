#### The symmetry and asymmetry journey design 

Many visitors are confused about how to navigate the museum because the number and density of artworks in the general exhibition makes it difficult for visitors to know which works to focus on and how to navigate. Designers then need to develop principles for the visitor experience and evaluate whether the design is effective. For example, visitors are provided with a supportive, multi-sensory experience while touring; have access to more information; and have enough time to stay and view.

#### Focus on the goals of an experience

Every design process starts with concrete and specific goals and outcomes that guide the entire process, which means that the goals may be audience-centered and meaningful to the contexts. Once the goals of an experience, designers curate the following details, including means of delivery, content, media, and technologies, in alignment with the goals. If curators emphasize too much on technology, or draw attention to technology/content at the very start, it is very likely that they may lead to abstract or inappropriate deliveries.
