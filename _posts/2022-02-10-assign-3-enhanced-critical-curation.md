Several points caught my attention while reading this text. 
- First of all, the evocation of the trade-off between compression and performance that seems to be fulfilled by the catologue. Language, through vocabulary and grammar, in a general way also have to position itself with respect to this duality. It would be interesting to know if it is possible to quantify the performance of various catalogs with respect to this trade-off. 
- The sentence "data from the past can no longer be assumed to possess a priori value" seems to me also presumptuous in the systematic devaluation of the past. In many fields, this data is of rare value as long as it can be appropriated.
- Following the enumeration of the various communities gravitating around these tasks ("scholars, archivists, museum curators, catalogers and librarians"), I am very curious to discuss the potential evolution of these attributions and the new ones that will arise.
