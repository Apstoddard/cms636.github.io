## ICA BOSTON

I think the ICA Boston does quite a strong job with their digital footprint, and I'll go over a couple reasons why below (while answering the questions that were given):

- The museum is successful in presenting itself as an institution that is plentiful with new exhibitions. This is actually quite surprising, because I felt the ICA was nothing too special or different on subsequent visits. On the website, not only do they do a good job of making the current exhibits a centerpiece of their homepage, but they also have an easily accessible archives delineated by year that highlights all old exhibits.
- On the note of COVID, I believe the ICA's website prepared well for a post-pandemic return. They clearly state admission policy and publicize the limited capacity. In addition to this, however, I noticed the ICA recently integrated the Instagram API on their website to showcase their feed on the homepage. Their current feed showcases visitors in small groups wearing masks back in the physical space of the museum, which I'm sure is done with the intent of easing visitors back into the idea of visiting after such a long hiatus.
- I'm perhaps most astounded by the ICA's proactive efforts towards community engagement. There is an entire section in the Navigation bar dedicated to "Learning". ICA Teens is an award-winning teen arts program with its own separate interface. A quick glance reveals a multitude of opportunities for youth in and around Boston, such as arts engagement programs and teen night events. In addition to youth programs, there are also educator resource guides to set up school/teacher visits and tours. Super neat and in-depth to a degree I have not seen before.
- Regarding community engagements, the ICA has set up the Watershed in East Boston, partnering with boat tour agencies to offer musuem-goers a ride across the bay to a separate location. Even cooler to realize that it was a former condemned space that they worked to transform into a "civic and cultural asset", by partnering with local affiliates like the East Boston Shipyard, Boston Public Schools, East Boston Neighborhood Health Center, etc. I was not aware civic engagement could come through the select engagements they formed with local partners, as well. Cheers to the ICA.
