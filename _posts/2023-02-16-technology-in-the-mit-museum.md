Baitul Ma’mur (House of Angles), 2021 **

The genetic gallery that Rachel and I visited, has a corner that is dedicated to showcasing three different things, namely "art, science, and divinity" combined in one place. However, the role of technology in this environment was ambiguous. The role of the 12 screens on the wall was not overt; why can’t that be substituted with a printout, for example, like the ones on the wall next to the vending machine?
The label indicated that the geometries of the term "Subhan Allah" and their tremendous ways of synthesizing DNA molecules, combined with the nesting calligraphy, which is something common to Islamic art, are grounded in the way art, science, and divinity can be combined in one place to show the utilitarian function of Islamic art.
The artists wanted to accentuate that and showcase the symbolic references of the various angles of the term "Subhan Allah." It appeared that there are several ways to use technology to engage the visitor, such as allowing the visitor to interact and see different phrases and calligraphy to demonstrate how their geometry and angles can create an infinite number of DNA molecules.
