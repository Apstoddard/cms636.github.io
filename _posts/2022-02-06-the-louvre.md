**LOUVRE AT HOME**
It is divided into four sections: stories, Louvre Kids, virtual tours, and VR experiences, each aimed at different groups of the audience or sets of needs. Like other online museums, the Louvre provides podcasts, HD pictures, graphic audio, and description materials for the online visitors on the virtual tours. However, unlike other online tours, the Louvre has a 360° menu to direct users, which makes it more user-friendly.

The digital collection database includes more than 480,000 works from the Louvre. Updated on a daily basis, it provides a wide range of data and information about the collections on display and those held in the treasury.

Something special about the Louvre at home are its stories and Louvre Kids parts, which serve an educational function. For instance, the Louvre (probably targeted at children less than 10-years-old) provides animated videos about the history and stories of the objects. In the stories section (probably targeted at older teenagers), the narration videos are made into a stage play-like format, with the narrator explaining the details and stories of the paintings in a passionate and lively tone, which is very appealing.
