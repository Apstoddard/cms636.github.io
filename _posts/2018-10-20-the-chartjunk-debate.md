title: The Chartjunk Debate
author: Caspar

The text outlines a debate of whether graphics beyond what conveys hard data can be helpful or not in information visualization. It starts off presenting Tufte and Holmes as champions of the different camps, Tufte being against and Holmes being for non-data elements. Tufte's argument is that anything not directly conveying data is often harmful to the effectiveness of the visualization, calling it chart junk. Holmes, on the other hand, argues that creative and elaborate ways of displaying information can make it more interesting and easier to remember - mostly using a study titled "Useful Junk? The Effects of Visual Embellishment on Comprehension and Memorability of Chart" to back up his argument.

When the study is presented however, it is appearent that it is both not as definitive as the supporters of embellishment claim it to be, but most importantly, also very badly designed. While the embellished examples were all made by Holmes, who usually makes well thought out embellishments that stick to the theme of the numbers, the "minimalist" examples were mostly badly designed - neither of which are representative for how most graphs appear in the real world. That the study was also conducted on a small sample of 20 people, all of whom were college students, means that the results are at best reliable for a very specific combination of people and charts - though most probably they simply can't be trusted.

In the end, there is still no conclusive evidene of whether embellished or un-embellished charts are superior, but I think author's suggestion of looking at what the case calls for doesn't seem like a bad idea.
