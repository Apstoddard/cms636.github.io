> To curate is to filter, organize, craft, and, ultimately, care for a story composed out of the infinite array of potential tales, relics, and voices.

Great museum exhibits do not necessarily show great work and a large number of physical objects, but tell stories that get people to think about the objects and kindle a desire to understand the subject. I believe that we may not urge everyone to understand or agree with the stories behind the scenes since everyone enters the space with their own stories formulated by various social, cultural, and personal experiences and backgrounds. They may even have completely different viewpoints. However, this is natural and acceptable, as stories in museums may even just reveal fragments of histories or contexts and can be complex when viewed from different perspectives. Nevertheless, stories should at least reveal the tangible and intangible cultures, being just, critical, and thought-provoking.Â
