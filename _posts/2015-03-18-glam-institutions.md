The perspective of GLAM institutions as organizations of public trust and public good is refreshing. As a native Washingtonian, almost all of my museum experiences have been free. Being free, the spaces lived in the balance of belonging to everyone but not necessarily being responsive or relevant to everyone. The National Air and Space Museum was the closest I came to interactivity: it has a hands-on exhibit that has remained exactly the same since I was very young. However, I fondly remember the National Children’s Museum. It was culturally responsive (I remember a huge Harry Potter day event) and child centric (there was an interactive museum exhibit about bubbles there that led me to do my science fair project about bubbles). 

However, I have never felt connected to a museum in the same way that I have felt connected to libraries. My family does not have Netflix. We get movies and DVDs from the library. We cleaned out the shelves of the libraries weekend after weekend. My mom’s audiobooks was always playing in the car. I am more comfortable in a library than I ever will be to a museum. I think it is about the physicality of bring something from a library home that makes a connection. A museum is more of a bestowal of foreign, academic knowledge. My grandmother lives near the Anacostia Museum in DC. As a small, unintimidating museum, it clearly was meant for community engagement. But, the top of African-American history did not overcome the institutional aura of the place. It never became a comfortable, relatable place. In my opinion, the museum failed to actually pursue outreach opportunities on the assumption that black communities would flock to African-American history.

I do wish that our museums and libraries did seek deeper connections with the community and seek to reflect our stories. I am in love with the idea of the community based exhibition model and the Great Good Place (the third place). I would be incredibly interested in exploring combinations of maker spaces and fab labs as the third place.
