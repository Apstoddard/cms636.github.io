Cultural Continuity

East Campus is about to be renovated (as many dorms at MIT have been or will be). The East Side of campus has been a community of trust, understanding, and self-determination for a lot of people. As the people in these communities have been frequently displaced over the last dozen years for various reasons (dorms closing, getting renovated, pandemics), I think it would be nice to get a sense of the values of this community that have stayed in tact. This is a way of both documenting an important aspect of MIT Student Life to the MIT Public, and also to provide hope and inspiration for future communities of MIT students to maintain these values, should they find they want to. 

I think the MIT-Museum would be the main partner for this project.

Technological Approach:

I think what I would like to do is create a “Web” of stories, connecting stories from past MIT East Side residents (scraped from here: https://ec.mit.edu/culture/start-here/ , perhaps), to current ones (that would probably have to be gathered through interviews or soliciting writings). I am very open to ideas of how to represent that web, could be a physical exhibit or a virtual interactive one. I think the connections can be based on thematic content, which we can maybe evaluate through doing some natural language processing. 

Skills Needed:
Designers (graphic or other)
Writers/Journalists
Natural Language Processing, Web Scraping
