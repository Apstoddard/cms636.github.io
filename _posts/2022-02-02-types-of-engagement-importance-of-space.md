## Commentary: "The Participatory Museum"

One of Nina Simon's primary theses is that museums should give visitors the tools to help them become "creative agents" themselves. This is an intriguing idea, and one I honestly think children's museums have generally done a good job of for a long time, but which general-audience museums have been more hesitant to attempt. It's widely accepted that spaces for children should have elements of play and engagement, but "grown-up" museums, maybe especially art museums, often seem designed more for quiet contemplation. I wonder what different kinds of museums could learn from each other about engaging different kinds of audiences. This can also tie in to the idea that art museums should make you want to "do art," as Nina Simon says. But why stop at encouraging visitors to "do art?" Maybe interactive exhibits could also do a better job of guiding visitors to critique and analyze art, or to curate art, or to theorize about art. 

## Commentary: "At the Foot of the Hill"

I am struck by the dedication to conservation, to accessibility, and to shared human history required to not only replicate the art of the Lascaux cave but also the cave itself. In addition to being an enormous undertaking, this approach also emphasizes the importance of space on the experience of a work of art. Removed from its context, removed from its space, the cave art would be transformed. Still art, but not THE Lascaux cave art -- something different. In this sense, Lascaux IV is of course still not THE Lascaux cave art, but it acknowledges the significance and integrity of the original.
