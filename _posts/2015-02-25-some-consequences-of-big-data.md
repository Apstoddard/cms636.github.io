With Big Data emerging as worthwhile and valid research field it's extremely important to keep
in mind its limitations. As Boyd and Crawford state, it may not be ethical to collect/analyze
some of the big data repositories in existence. Collecting some data off of Facebook may seem
innocuous but it's a slippery slope that can lead to outcomes like ... the NSA monitoring all of our phone calls. So the question is where do you draw the line? Asking people if you can collect
their data leads to response bias which, although Big Data tries to negate it as much possible, is
not good. At some point, it comes down to trusting the researchers. That usually doesn't work so well though.

On the topic of bias, I believe that one of the purposes of Big Data is to reduce bias/subjectivity.
This is why the Data is so Big. Large datasets naturally minimize outliers and other "bad" data (I
would also argue that no data is bad unless you collect it incorrectly) in order to make statistical
models happier. My opinion goes against what Boyd and Crawford perceive because I don't think they have a sense of how big the Big Data is. In 2011, when this paper was written, storage and computation were about 3x more expensive than they are today. Big Data occupies thousands of terabytes on computers distributed across the world. Additionally, the authors are assuming that a human is going to play an important role in manipulating/interpreting the data which isn't necessary correct. We, as humans, know that we're biased so we come up with statistics, models, and machines to remove our bias. As time progresses and computers assume more work, the data analysis will become less biased to the point where it doesn't matter anymore.
