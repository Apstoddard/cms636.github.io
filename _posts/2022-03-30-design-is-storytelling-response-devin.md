One of the analogies that really got me on board with the Design as Storytelling concept is the one about Chipotle. The line at chipotle and similar establishments  is a human centered experience, where you make choices and interact with your food before it’s given to you. I think this practice of really sitting down and thinking “What is this experience like for the user, from beginning to end?” will be helpful in our final projects. 
Building on that, I think the examples of narrative and the rollercoaster example are great ways to think about designing a more engaging experience in our projects. I’m thinking about what parts of our exhibit will be the “exposition” and give context, how will we introduce some questions or problems surrounding that context, and how can we actually build the required suspense or drama around those contexts to keep users engaged in our projects.
