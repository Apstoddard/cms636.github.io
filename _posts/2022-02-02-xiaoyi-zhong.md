Hi there! My name is Xiaoyi (Zoe) Zhong. I am an aspiring learning designer and a current Master's student in the Learning Design, Innovation, and Technology Program at Harvard University. I have prior experience in curriculum and course development, learning design, and video production. By integrating human-centered design, authentic assessment, and DEIB principles, I hope to create an inclusive, situated, and meaningful learning experience that promotes deeper learning and celebrates diversity.
