## "The Experience Economy" Commentary

I found this reading very intriguing and informative. While I was expecting something more along the lines of the experience in a museum, I found it more enjoyable than I had thought since the points made in the reading can be applied to multiple places, not just museums.

The authors were very clear in what they believed were essential to creating an memorable experiences from talking about having an engaging theme that changed the audience's sense of reality to having the audience experience the place with all five of their senses. While it is not something that has really occured to me before, the explanations of the principles made a lot of sense and explained many things to me, such as why a lot of places of entertainment had food (not just because people typically enjoy eating) and why some of the most popular places have a certain theme to them, such as Disneyland or Seaworld.

A lot of these principles can certainly be applied to museums in their own way and already are in most cases. I think museums can follow this reading as a guide to how they can improve and be able to attract more people. While some of the ideas may be harder to implement such as food since it can tend to make a mess, the other ideas can be inspiring and simply just bring up some new concepts they can introduce in the museums.
