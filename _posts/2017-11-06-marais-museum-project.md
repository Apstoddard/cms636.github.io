**Description**
My Omeka Exhibit groups together images of people from similar groups, such as "L'Aristocrate" and "Gens du Peuple." Visitors can see how the clothes and lifestyles of people from these different groups differed from one another

**Method**
I used a python script to go through the csv file and extract the images where the "Subject: People" had L'Aristocrate in the column. I then uploaded these files to the Omeka site with their corresponding metadata from the csv.

**Challenges**
I found the Omeka site a bit difficult to use and confusing at times. I wanted to upload both my images and their matching metadata from the csv file, but couldn't find a way to do so. I also didn't find much correlation between the columns in the csv and the Omeka categories when I tried the csv plugin. There seemed to be no way of uploading an entire directory of images to the site, so I had to individually add each one, which was tedious
