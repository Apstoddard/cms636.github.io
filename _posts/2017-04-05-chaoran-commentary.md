> Augmented space also represents an important challenge and an opportunity for contemporary architecture. As the examples discussed in this essay demonstrate, while many architects and interior designers have actively embraced electronic media, they typically think of it in a limited way: as a screen, i.e., as something that is attached to the  ‘real’ stuff of architecture, i.e. surfaces defining volumes.

Although I believe that in the future architects will use virtual reality technology to design houses, how long can we approach that future will be a problem. First, what kind of material on the facade should be applied besides the screen? Second, besides acting as the ornament of the architecture, what other possibilities can merge VR technology? Third, what kind of spatial meaning will the VR bring to the people who use the architecture beyond the experimental meaning?


> Can this situation be reversed? Can cultural institutions play an active, even a leading, role, acting as laboratories where alternative futures are tested? Augmented space – which is slowly becoming a reality – is one opportunity for these institutions to take a more active role. While many video installations already function as laboratories for developing new configurations of images within space, museums and galleries as a whole could use their own unique asset – a physical space – to encourage the development of distinct new spatial forms of art and new spatial forms of the moving image. In this way, they can take a lead in testing outone part of the augmented space future.  

Does the author mean that the museum can be a physical space to exhibit and test the augmented reality items? It definitely will be an exciting point to attract the tourists in the museum. So why now most museums have not been the laboratories for this technology? I think that will be the question we need to answer. Does the technology mature enough to bring the whole visit of the museum a fresh and comfortable experience? How can the museums support large sums of the test items without losing their original identity?
Will the new virtual reality galleries be more professional and more influential？
