# What is a museum

The article describes the different definitions and the evolving function of "the museum", as well as the contribution of museums to culture and public education; however, one glaring neglection of the article is its failure to address the negative impacts of museums. The article mentions that "a commitment to community or social welfare have grown to be important aims for the museum in the last century", but this brings attention to the limited definition of "social welfare". The "social welfare" in this context only considers the welfare of the society the museum itself is in, as opposed to considering it from a broader viewpoint of humanity as a whole. The article does not acknowledge the type of cultural discontinuity as the result of objects being taken away from the countries and cultures which they originally belong to. The loss of artifacts and the resulting loss of identity can be damaging for a culture, and these culture are generally excluded from the mainstream discourse when we are considering "social welfare". In the post-colonial 21st century, one important question we should be asking ourselves is how to build museums ethically such that it does not built itself upon the exploitation of other cultures.
