The (Limiting) Effects of Automation on Human Knowledge
As someone directly involved with an automation-based project, I believe that automated procedures are extremely useful for  both efficiency and simplification of many difficult or time-consuming tasks. However there's a catch: you need to know exactly what you're doing, and what you're doing and what you want. In the case of collection and analysis of large sets of humanities data this is rarely the case, mainly because the collected data is often extremely versatile, and research questions are rarely quantitative. So as "data worshipers" (exemplified in the text by the Wired editor Chris Anderson) keep advocating the ineffability of numbers, it is critical that humanities scholars play an active role in the development of any tool for humanities big data.
