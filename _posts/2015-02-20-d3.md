[D3 (Data-Driven Documents)](http://d3js.org) is a powerful JavaScript library that makes it easy to load and visualize data sets within a web page. It's particularly handy to use to generate graphics from data retrieved through [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)s, and there's a large community of open source contributors around it making handy variations and templates you can use.
