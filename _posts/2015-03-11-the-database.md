So I found this article kind of frustrating. On the one hand, Manovich seems to believe that artists using new media are capable of producing arresting, interesting works, and then on the other believes that just because their databases are explicit, they're worth less.

My feeling is that he is rather hypocritical. If I showed him something I called "a linear narrative constructed from a database of sentences" and then handed him a book on a computer, it sounds like his argument is that its worth less because I worked from existing data. If I printed the same book and handed it to him, would he rejoice in it being "the perfect random access medium" and how its narrative must have been sublimely constructed from thin air? 

He also ignores that books go through the same editing process as film. Sure, film tends to be a bit heavy on extra material that doesn't make it to the final cut, but editors exist for authors and often they start with much more material than finally shows up in the finished product. He talks about how playing computer games can be reduced to the act of 

If you couldn't tell, I have a personal grudge against people who hold books up as the perfect example of a true medium. I work a lot in interactive (the dreaded word) media on computers, and when I see someone have a lower opinion of games or other pieces of new media simply because they're not the cherished pastime of books, I get angry.
