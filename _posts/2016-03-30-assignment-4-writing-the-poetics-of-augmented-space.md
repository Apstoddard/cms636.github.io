title: "Assignment 4 Writing - “The Poetics of Augmented Space”,"
---

In 1968, Douglas Engelbart gave a presentation to a room of people. This presentation came to be called “The Mother of All Demos, presented by Douglas Engelbart (1968).” This was a turning point for computers and is not very well known about. It’s common knowledge about how computers used to be before this point (early on): massive, literally filling a whole room, used for large and intense calculations.  It’s also common knowledge about the modern computer: small, compact, useable by anyone, and has a multitude of features and abilities. This presentation was the first time the modern computer we know was presented to the world. A usable machine with a friendly user interface that is truly functional. From this point on, you could say the idea of augmented reality became real. Computers were now usable, for the most part, to any person. 

There’s a fact that has been floating around the internet for a while: that a modern iPhone has more computer power than the total sum of computer used to land Apollo 11 on the Moon. To think about the scale of how fast we’ve gone from barely powering a space ship to power your phone in only 47 years (between then and today) is mind blowing. Technology has been developing at a rapid pace and is now present everywhere. You’d be surprised to find something that doesn’t have technology either in it, or heavily involved in the production of the object.  The idea of virtual reality is not too far out of reach either. Virtual and Augmented reality is discussed in the reading assigned for this week. At this point, it’d be hard to go a day without experiencing some sort of augmented reality due to the basic fact that we are always using technology. This helps change the way we experience everyday.
