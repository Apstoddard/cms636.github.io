**Where stone can speak**
Thiel emphasizes the engagement in her works “with the web of meaning” through “special qualities of the site itself, its genius loci” other than “a passive viewing of material.” She steers the conversation back to esthetic and dramatic coherence of art works from realism. I find the discussion of “the classic character-centered narrative viewpoint” VS “first-person experiential viewpoint” interesting and love the diagram on page 7 and the correlation with the autonomy of space. I wish they could elaborate on that. Because the curatorial deliberation can not always be delivered to the experience/user, or through the way they've imagined.  ![Screen Shot 2022-02-17 at 7.40.55 AM.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Screen Shot 2022-02-17 at 7.40.55 AM.png)

It seems the “kinesthetic, full body sensory” real place has been compared or discussed in parallel with virtual reality. Most of the literature I’ve encountered degrade one and celebrate another, and I wonder if this competition is necessary.

The title **Cyber-Animism and Augmented dream**s speaks for Thiel’s ambition regarding AR and computer generated image. The consensual hallucination quality of AR is highly celebrated. I read Mark Hansen’s New Philosophy for New Media where he draws from henry bergson’s concept of the bodily affectivity to explain the user experience with ER is kind of interesting if you are into theoretical debate over ER VS reality.
It’s funny that she talked about the contamination of the technology with house rent ad and solipsistic tweets.
