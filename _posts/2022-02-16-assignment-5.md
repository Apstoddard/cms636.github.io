## "Cyber-Animism and Augmented Dreams"

Tamiko Thiel's core concepts seem to revolve around the idea of connecting the physical world with worlds that cannot be seen with the human eye. Since she grew up learning about she lived in a world with spirits and ghosts of the past, it seems to be a part of her life she enjoys. When it is essentially taken away when she moves, her new home seems rather bleak to her, so she finds creating art that creates a bridge between the two worlds enjoyable.

Her view of AR could be used in museum spaces, specifically ones that seem too small. While it could be used in larger museum spaces to create a more immersive environment, it could be useful in smaller museums. It would show parts of the displays that cannot be shown through the lens of a phone and can be used as much as the audience wants. Not only could AR make the displays seem more alive, but it could also display information in a unique way to get the visitors more engaged. Based on these observations, we could use AR to display something a museum currently cannot or use it to get people more interested in visiting museums because there would be something new they could experience.
