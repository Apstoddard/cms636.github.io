Design is storytelling 

This reading really helped me reframe our project. I outlined below a few learnings that I will make sure to use:  

Letting our design speak for itself
One key aspect is thinking about your design as the story itself that unfolds to the user. I usually think about how we will tell the story of the designed product, what would be really interesting is adopting Lupton’s approach and letting the product speak for itself. 

Designing the story through architecture 
I believe the architectural elements of a designed intervention can significantly influence the user’s experience. As pointed out in the reading in the example comparing McDonald’s setup to Chipotle, a musuem curator can add, remove or turn walls to influence the visitor’s perception of the space and experience; eventually affecting the way they spend their time and the stories they make. Beyond physical architecture, digital experience can also be architected to highlight certain senses or feelings throughout the user journey. 

Rethinking the why 
One thing that really stood out in the reading is the power the designer has to influence the human emotions of the users or even the people this solution is being presented to. One key message is that we have a lot of power, however our designs should not be overpowering on the user. The experience overall should be seamlessly designed and virtually unrecognizable; for example Ikea’s setup is very unique however it does not significantly affect the users ability to make decisions in the store.
