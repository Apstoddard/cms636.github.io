- When organizing the exhibitions, which part did you struggle with organizing the most?
- Is there a particular medium you enjoy working with the most?
- Where did the inspiration for each of the exhibitions come from?
- How does the curator talk about the exhibitions such as Robota? Robota in particular seems to have a lot of information behind it, but how is the information presented in a way that keeps the visitors interested?
