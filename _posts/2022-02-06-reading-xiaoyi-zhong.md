## What is a museum
I think the process of museum transformation is the process of gradually putting "human" at the center.

In terms of the function and theme of museums, initially, the main function of museums was to collect and preserve. And occasionally, the objects were displayed in a very impersonal way, all stacked together without any sense of beauty or design. But soon, museum designers and administrators became aware of these problems. Therefore, in order to cater to the aesthetics, preferences, and ways of thinking of people, exhibitions of museum objects began to be organized, and many exhibits began to be categorized by history, culture, etc. In the 21st century, various types of museums have emerged as a result of new social trends, and many of the themes and exhibitions of these new museums cater to these social trends, such as LGBTQ, race, climate change, etc.

In terms of the design of museums, although modern museums have different themes, I think designers are increasingly concerned about the role of the visitor in the museum. Exhibitions and visitors are no longer separated. Instead, museums are increasingly focusing on the role of visitors, and even visitors are becoming part of the exhibition. Designers use different media, technologies, tools, or exhibits and spatial layouts to engage visitors' thoughts and reflections, encouraging them to participate in various activities, giving full play to "people" and "ideas."

## The Curiosity Cabinet as Metamorphe
The Curiosity Cabinet connects the past and the present in a way that is both encyclopedic and seemingly disorderly, yet "actively performs the entangled nature of objects through their selection and categorisation of material". The Curiosity Cabinet moves between history and the present and helps us focus on objects, images, and ideas on a completely different scale.
