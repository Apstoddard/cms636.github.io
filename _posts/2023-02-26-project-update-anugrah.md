**Problem/Issue being addressed**

When walking through the AI exhibit at the MIT museum I was quite unconvinced that it could substantively educate people about how modern AI works. The parts that I connected with most were the gigantic physical machines and not the small AI writeups. I think part of the issue lies in novelty - now that ChatGPT exists and is so easy to use, interactive displays (like the poem writing one) don’t actually add anything meaningful that you couldn’t just accomplish at home. 

However I think it is quite possible to create a more informative addition to the AI exhibit that explains the rough methods behind the high level ideas in modern machine learning/AI instead of just explaining the high level ideas so quickly that the viewer just gets lost.

**Envisioned audience**

The intended audience for such an exhibit would probably be an adult or a highschool student. I think having some rough background in what modern technology looks like would be helpful, and I don’t know if someone too much younger could take much away in terms of the high level details.


**Potential museum collaborators**

I think a project along these lines would really only work at someplace like the MIT museum. Throughout its history, MIT has been pretty tightly connected to the growth of technology, and I think such additions would fit naturally into the AI exhibit.

**Technological/spatial approach**

I think the ideal presentation of this project would probably be something like 2 smaller informative demos with sparse text that visualize what a neural network is, and how they can be applied to images (i.e. adding in a few things like convolutions on images). Then we could have a cutting edge demo that shows some piece of technology that has been big on the internet in the recent few months and rotates every once in a while. For example, given the current internet interest about image generation models like DALL-E, we could have an interactive demo that somehow works in real-time e.g. a local server that hosts a StableDiffusion model and allows people to play around with different parameters.

**Skill sets needed**

Primarily this sub-exhibit would require knowledge of modern machine learning, some UI/UX design for creating the actual interfaces, and some basic web scripting experience.
