We focused on the women of Mairas during this period of time by selecting photos that portray Mairas women. Through these photos, we only get snapshots of their lives and attempt to piece them the puzzle pieces together to understand the whole picture of their stories. We see their daily activities, their status, and their roles in the society. We get a sense that these women's identities were tied/limited to home and family. We had to manually upload the images and titles so we weren't able to link the dates, but it was really interesting to see the progressions of the portraits from groups of women to a single portraits, signifying to progression to valuing the individuality of women.
