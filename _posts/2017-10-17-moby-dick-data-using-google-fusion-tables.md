title: Moby Dick Data Using Google Fusion Tables
author: Maya Madhavan
---
After using the given instructions to input the Moby Dick data I changed around different settings to see what would happen. Generally speaking, I found that the Fusion tables convenient and useful for visualizing spatial data. The bucketing and heatmap features were particularly interesting, as was the option of editing the info window.

However, there were a few things that could be changed. For example, the bucketing mechanism isn’t intuitive, and it reverse changes isn’t a straightforward process. Additionally, the need to change columns when editing info windows seems impractical.
