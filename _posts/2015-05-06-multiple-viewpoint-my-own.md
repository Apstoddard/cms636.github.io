In the excerpt from Jenkins et al, the old literary practice such as close reading, allusion, multiculturalism,  and structural analysis are argued to be expand to include moves and moods of digital culture such as creative engagement and collective-meaning making. 

In thinking about my experiences in studying literature, I feel as though most of these skills were emphasized. When I was younger, more creative interaction with texts was encouraged, perhaps because we were too young to fully verbalize our ideas. I think I did not real experience a connection with literature that I studied in school until my sophomore year of high school. My teacher forced us to read closely in a different manner than I had experienced and introduced the idea that literature could be interpreted and was not a static thing. This idea opened my eyes to the study of literature and caused me to engage more with the text I was reading. I don't know whether she encouraged a subtle form of teenage rebellion but I became more distrusting of 'official' interpretations of works of literature in favor of my own interpretation. As time passed, I learned to balance different view points yet I still look for my own reaction to literature. I believe this skill was not something I would have been taught if I was in a situation. I think educators who acknowledge and encourage conflicting and unpopular viewpoints force their students to see literature in a different way. As the article touched on, many students feel as though their input will not be worthy or good enough for discussion. By bringing up the myriad of possible ideas about a text, students will be encouraged to provide their own viewpoints.

This practice also can help students analyze texts through multicultural methods, if used correctly. If the viewpoints shown to the students are diverse in where they come from and who says them, then the students can gain an understanding of other views. This practice I still struggle with and am working to improve upon. For myself, I have found talking to people from different backgrounds and reading works by people different from me, help me to gain new ways of looking a texts than those I would previously. In my formal education, multicultural view were not often brought up and if so did not make a lasting impression. Diverse and varied viewpoints must be presented often for students to internalize them.
