The data visualization is to be communicated. Based on this fundamental concept, the author uses layer and color as two elements to 

Besides, this article is talking about the visualization more than the field of data representation but also  the graphical interfaces, photographs and mathematical diagrams. This raises some questions in my mind, for instance, how to define the different layers in the web page with abundant information,
