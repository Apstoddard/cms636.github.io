	Manovich makes an interesting point that I had not considered previously.  He argues: “ The database becomes the center of the creative process in the computer age.” He goes on to talk about the separation of interface and content, a separation that has not historically existed in artistic mediums.   I found this fascinating, as I had never considered a database to be a creative thing, nor had I considered exactly how separating content and interface affect the viewer or user.   With the interface and content separated, the content of a website can have myriad representation.  Manovich also claims that using or exploring a webpage can become a narrative experience.  In this way I see a link between narrative and database instead of a rivalry. When the user dictates the narrative, the trajectory of that narrative is not necessarily linear, but can be varied and unpredictable.  

	I think that the web is changing our definition of narrative and database and how the two interact.  Perhaps narrative and database can coexist and build upon each other through well-constructed user interfaces.  This separation of content and interface the Manovich describes opens doors for how one can manipulate both content and interface to create a new type of narrative that is intertwined with data.  I think we have yet to see the full potential of how database and narrative can work together to create a richer user experience, but as a designer, I am excited to explore the advantages and disadvantages of this separations between content and interface.
