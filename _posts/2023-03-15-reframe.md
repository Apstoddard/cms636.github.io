Usually mosaics are associated with more "serious" art with political or religious associations; for example, in the Soviet Union, mosaics are created for propaganda reasons that glorify the Soviet achievements and emphasize the ideology of the communist party

In Islamic art, mosaics are rich in symbolism and the creation of them is an expression of faith.

This mosaic piece is quite surprising at first, as if it's an oxymoron of using a serious medium to feature a deconstructivist modern art piece. The reframe of this mosaic piece is interesting because it describes the theme of the work well. In addition, it also describes the materials used in the piece, which also have significance and are unconventional.

## Additional Reframe

Despite the museum's efforts in tracing the troubled history of the collected objects, there are some things that are understated. A museum can be portrayed as a passive party having a collection of objects that have a troubled past, but it can also be an active participant in the acquisition of the objects. In the case of the Harvard Art Museums, one example is the Fogg expeditions, as described in this article from 1925. (https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1925/3/20/second-fogg-museum-expedition-now-preparing/). One potentially interesting reframe can be describing the history of Harvard's archaeological expeditions and what objects were acquired from them, as well as the associated controversies.
