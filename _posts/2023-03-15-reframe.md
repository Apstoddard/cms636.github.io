Usually mosaics are associated with more "serious" art with political or religious associations; for example, in the Soviet Union, mosaics are created for propaganda reasons that glorify the Soviet achievements and emphasize the ideology of the communist party

In Islamic art, mosaics are rich in symbolism and the creation of them is an expression of faith.

This mosaic piece is quite surprising at first, as if it's an oxymoron of using a serious medium to feature a deconstructivist modern art piece. The reframe of this mosaic piece is interesting because it describes the theme of the work well. In addition, it also describes the materials used in the piece, which also have significance and are unconventional.
