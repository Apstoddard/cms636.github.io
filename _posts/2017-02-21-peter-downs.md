[Peter](http://peterdowns.com) is a third year undergraduate studying computer science. His first foray into programming was with [Bookshrink](http://bookshrink.com) â€“ he's been interested in building tools that further our understanding of text ever since. Before coming to MIT he spent time in San Francisco working as a software engineer, and maintains a healthy interest in artistic creation through digital media and photography.
