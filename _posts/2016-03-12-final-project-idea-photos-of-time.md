## Project Title ##
Photos of Time

## Approach ##
In this project, we would create a website where the user sees a map of the Earth and has a slider to set the date to a different point in time. They can then click on the map of Earth, and a drawing or photograph will pop up of the point in time and space they selected.

## Audience ##
Our audience would be general, since the website would be easy to use and I believe everyone will be interested in playing with the tool. Perhaps historians would be most interested to learn how landscapes change over centuries of human inhabitance.

## Skills Needed ##
This approach would require gathering thousands of images and labeling them with spatial and temporal information. It would thus require back-end programming skills and database technology knowledge.
It would also require creating a responsive and attractive front-end and thus require knowledge of HTML5 and JQuery.
