## Questions for K. Gresh
  
- What draws you to particular photography pieces? What was a critical photograph or photographer that aided in your development in photography & curation?
- How do you balance personal appreciation and general public interest in collections where you have to whittle down the number of pieces from thousands to a small set number? What considerations go into the storytelling (or lack thereof) among the images?
- How do you grapple with bent interpretations of photographs? For example, Ruth Orkin's _American Girl in Italy_, 1951, became a "representation of male harrassment of women" which was far from the original intent of the photograph. Do you welcome these new interpretations or is it the curator's responsibility to fight for the photographer's intentions to be understood & accepted by the public?
