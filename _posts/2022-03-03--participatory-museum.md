My idea is that there are so many ways and means for participatory museums, such as allowing visitors to contribute to an exhibition, express their views on the exhibition, communicate in a shared space, and so on. But I want to emphasize that participation is not the ultimate goal of a museum, but a powerful tool to achieve it. Using participation, museums can make new connections and foster creativity and the generation of new ideas. Likewise, participation can construct collective dialogues that engage people in different ways, forms, and times.
