The Museum of Science is located as a bridge across the Charles River which enjoys the view from both side. It could be regarded as the paradise for families especially those with children under 10. Everywhere is full of activities and interactions are not only between participants and objects but also participants with participants, for children like to join children’s play.

The three wings each have specific topic and installations are arranged comparatively free (image 1) compared to formal galleries like the MFA. There is no fixed route and no concept of showroom. Corridors are enlarged from time to time for installations and devices. Games(image 2) are the main way to show and attract children. You may touch the screen for further information of the milk-way or go up and down stairs again and again in order to hear the sound of the stairs (image 3). The sound stair is really interesting for the space component is a part of the display of scientific knowledge. There is also live animal feeding room (image 4). The kitchen is open and you can see the staff busy preparing lunch for the animals. Audio explanation and Augmented Reality like the 4D theater also provide multiple experiences for children.

The museum is a successful case for the space itself could be seen as a platform for play. All the devices are toys. Technology helps to build various ways of playing and experience. It is user centered and experience concentrated.

There is some unexpected “parking lot” of the trolleys and some parents may take them as portable storage boxes. It is really interesting to see them as a show of various trolleys (image 5).
