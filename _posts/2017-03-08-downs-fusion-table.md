title: Playing with Fusion Table

My work isn't embeddable or linkable, because Google Maps ~~is trash and~~ won't let you use it on a real website without an API key. But it looks really pretty!

You can download [the raw HTML of this page](http://peterdowns.com/projects/cms633/downs-map.html) and open it on your local computer to see the final product.

Fusion Table was pretty good for a web-based spreadsheet viewer in that it handled many rows without crashing. With the guidelines I was able to complete all of the required tasks but without them I would have been lost entirely.

Having worked with Google Maps in the past for custom data visualization, it's pretty much the default game in town â€“ the other major competitor being Mapbox, which doesn't provide as many features. So although it's not as good as an experience as I'd like, it's the one to which I'll return in the future.
