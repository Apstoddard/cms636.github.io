I am currently taking a class called Digital Image Processing, which is primarily focused on teaching well established image processing techniques. Many of these techniques involve converting representations of digital images between the space and time domain. Normally, we think about images in the space domain: pixels in 2D with intensity values. One can also consider it in the time domain: waves of various frequencies constructively and/or destructively interfering in 2D to compose the image.

Representation of images in the frequency domain is useful in many engineering problems, but it's interesting to note that the “frequency” representation has a fairly direct correspondence to audible sound. One could sonificate images by mapping its Fourier transform to the audible spectrum. It makes me wonder if one could create art that could be appreciated in both the visual and auditory domains. This would coincide with Sterne and Akiyama's notion of plasticity of data - raw sound data being intelligible in a multitude of sensory representations.

One could conceivably apply this sonification process in reverse, and convert a sound into an image (but not simply a waveform) - what might a symphony look like if transformed into one large image? 

Oh Matlab, what would we do without you...
