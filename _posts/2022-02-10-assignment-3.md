## "Enhanced Critical Curation" Comments

I found it interesting that the author believes it is important to know about the historical background of curation to truly understand it and how knowledge in general was critical in the past. While it is true that in the past it was difficult to obtain and keep sources of information, even though it is much easier to access new information, there will always be some piece of information or knowledge that is gone forever. Although it is not possible for historical and cultural information to be considered have __a priori__ value anymore, it is not necessary a bad thing as all knowledge is good knowledge.
