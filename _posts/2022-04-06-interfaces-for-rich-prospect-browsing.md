title: Interfaces for “rich-prospect browsing”
author: Tiffany Tran
---
There were a lot of aspects surrounding technology, specifically the browsing, that cannot really be applied to my project, but I still found them interesting. I found the SWOT analysis to be most helpful for our project as there are a lot of components that can be changed based on how we want to display it. Focusing on each of the four aspects would help us narrow our project down so that all our ideas match.
