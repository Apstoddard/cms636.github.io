The age of computing and the rise of participatory culture is not just changing the set of relevant teaching material, it is also changing the way this material is consumed and retained. I feel that the lower education is woefully behind in supporting this change.

Before computers existed, recalling information which was not contained in one's memory was an arduous process, potentially involving a trip to a library. Therefore, it made good sense to learn as much as possible about any given topic at the time it is first taught. Today, this is not necessarily the case - vast amounts of easily searchable information are available within seconds. 

In this day and age, humanity has amassed such a massive corpus of scientific knowledge that one could spend many lifetimes learning, and still not know everything they might one day need. Considering this, I believe that the ability to quickly find information on demand is more important than rote memorization. 

If our goal is to produce productive members of society, teachers should teach students to quickly find what they need to know, and place emphasis on abstract problem solving skills, rather than spoon-feeding special cases of integrals. As it stands, most grade school tests aim to quantify how well you might do in an internet-free world, but frankly we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.

Of course, there is a big tradeoff here; if you have no idea what you're searching for, it will be much harder to find it. A high level view of what is out there is very important, but differentiating useful knowledge from unnecessary specifics is difficult without a deep level of familiarity with the subject matter. This is where I believe the educator can provide significant value: they are presumably knowledgable about the subject they are teaching, and are therefore in a much better position to determine what can be glossed over.

I was fortunate enough to learn early on that what I really wanted to know was out there, but it wasn’t going to be handed to me in fifth period Algebra. By teaching myself to program, and solving problems as they arose, I became a Google guru. Today, those skills help me in all areas of my life - I know that I can apply for new jobs or approach new problems without fear, because any knowledge that I lack is at my fingertips.

Now, it’s time for a metaphor. 

Knowledge is power; would you rather have an amazing battery, or real-time access to the biggest nuclear reactor on the planet?
