1. Do the scam letter narratives change over time? How much are they affected by major social and political events or the global media's portrayal of those events? 
2. As the spam filters are getting more and more accurate, it is becoming much harder for scammers to reach their potential victims. What are the techniques they use to avoid having their mail flagged as spam? Do the scammers have to alter their stories, or are the changes mostly technical?
3. While in almost all countries scamming people is a crime, there are some countries like Nigeria that are know for a huge number of scammers. What is the public perception of scammers in these coutries? Are they considered to be shady fraudsters or robin hoods?
