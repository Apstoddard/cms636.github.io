### Museums’ Use of Collections and Visitors’ Learning Experiences

Through different media and art forms, the multi-sensory museum separates objects and spaces from fixed time and space, allowing them to communicate in multiple forms and constructing a new exhibition experience. And in this environment, the concept of visitors has changed. Media makes communication between visitors and objects more natural and direct, so visitors are instead defined as people who can communicate with the space and exhibits, becoming facilitators of communication in the museum space.

### Integrating Multi-Sensory Experiences into Museums

The multi-sensory museum addresses the issue of accessibility and makes the museum a more inclusive and diverse place. Through different media, designers are able to explore not only how to make exhibitions more accessible and reach the disabled people, but also to rethink and reconstruct spaces from a multi-sensory perspective.
