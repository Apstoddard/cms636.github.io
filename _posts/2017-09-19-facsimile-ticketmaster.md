When observing the four different families of register pages, our group decided to focus on creating meaningful data visualizations for both travelers passing by the Comédie-Française in person or perusing its site. Since the Comédie-Française is one of the oldest actively running theatres in the world, we assumed that its audiences will be fascinated in learning about the historical data extracted from the facsimiles in a relevant context, and we wanted to make it accessible to them.

While it is compelling to view the facsimile information in its original form, it’s not necessarily meaningful to the viewer if they do not speak French nor use French currency. Travelers from across the globe are visiting the Comédie-Française to learn about it, so we believe that the best way of presenting this data is to translate it so that each individual can understand what they’re looking at. We’re aiming to contextualize these facsimiles by allowing users to browse a Historic Ticketmaster and customize a visualization output in the form of a ticket souvenir. 

Our prototype sketches showcase a large multitaction screen which would stand outside the Comédie-Française or in a niche within its auditorium. We’d create a web application for this screen that presents visitors with an interactive Historical Ticketmaster form which allows them to customize their own ticket, which can be printed in a tangible form via a printing machine. We can use the information for data we have on the dates, number of tickets purchased per show, and productions to create this, as well as combine this with already existing data of the Comédie-Française.
