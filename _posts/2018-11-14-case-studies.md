## Augmented Objects 

The Project being built on collection from the memory of the Jewish community while manipulating them in an augmented reality setting presents a rich perspective where the different artifacts are read in a continuous narrative to be displayed in an authentic setting in order to draw a more comprehensive meaning for the objects.The approach presents of course many challenges in the execution specially in relation of a high resolution in conveying the actual feel of the period of time these objects belong to. 

##Virtual Reconstruction

The virtual reconstruction of a refugee camp is definitly a challenging process, however very problematic, it might also lead to infidelity in conveying some features which might affect a lot of the misconception already built around these spaces. 
However, I think that the intent of bringing this experience for people who otherwise will not go inside a refugee camp would be an educational in the aim of bridging the gap and overcoming racism.
