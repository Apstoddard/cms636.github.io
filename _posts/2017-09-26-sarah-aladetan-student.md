Hello! My name is Sarah Aladetan and I'm currently a senior studying 21E with a minor in Music here at MIT! 21E is "Humanities & Engineering" so I get to study one of each of my choosing. My humanities concentration is Comparative Media Studies and my engineering concentration is Computer Science. I enjoy finding ways to combine the two (and a little music even!), hence my gravitation to this class. Outside of academics, you can find me singing on campus in the MIT Vocal Jazz Ensemble and R&B/Soul band "Love & a Sandwich"!
