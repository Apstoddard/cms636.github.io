I disagree with Lev Manovich's assertion that the database and narrative are natural enemies. A database is not a single thing, and few assumtions can be made about it. It is true that not all databases are ordered, but that does not mean that we cannot impose order upon them - traditional written narratives can in fact be entirely represented in a database in the form of text. This, to me, implies that Manovich is drawing an apples to oranges comparison without a full understanding of the underlying technology.

From here on, I will define "narrative" to mean any presentation of media that is intended to be consumed in a predifined trajectory.

Before the advent of computers, there were a very limited range of options for narrative - written works, illustrations, oral tradition and other primarily physical options were all we had. Today, our options are significantly broader, due simply to the fact that our methods of storing and presenting data have improved.

As Manovich aptly points out, the pre-internet-age narrative usually couples the interface with the underlying data. Databases allow us to decouple these things, and potentially use the same data set to convey a wide range of stories or interfaces. With this in mind, **I would assert that the database is in fact a complement to narrative,** opening the doors to a previously impossible forms of creative expression.

While it may be correct, I wouldn't assert that a book or other written narrative is just "a collection of words." Doing so would gloss over the greater significance of the semantics of those words that the author intended to convey. **Just as I don't think the pages of a book, or a blank canvas, are natural enemies of narrative, I would never say the same of a database.**
