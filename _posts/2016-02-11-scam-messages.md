I looked through my spam folder, and quickly appreciated how much better email-filters have improved in the past decade. Emails in my spam folder were nearly universally proper spam (instead of correct emails), though I did find some legitimate correspondence lost there.

Recurring themes in my spam included the ubiquitous Nigerian Prince narrative -- a rich "damsel in distress" persona who lost access to their funds and needs some capital to get it back, Viagra-esque and hooker low-effort commercials, and other emails designed to convince me to give away my personal information. A particularly interesting deviation from my expectations occurred when I discovered emails designed to sneak in with my daily-life emails: an invitation to a bogus conference with a registration form, an internship interview request to a software-looking company, a notice masquerading as a real MIT account asking for confirmation of financial aid/tuition/email quota. Spam and spam filters have gone through some kind of arms race -- both becoming increasingly tailored to user/target habits in attempts to outwit their opponents.
