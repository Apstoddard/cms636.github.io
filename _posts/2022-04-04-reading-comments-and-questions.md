## Exhibition and pedagogy: Probing Architecture’s Virtual past in museum cast collections
Pierre Levy’s interpretation of virtuality and reality as not the “opposite,” but “fecund and powerful mode of being” offers a new lens of understanding AR. Course wise, I wish that I could be in the studio, it looks fun!!! The project of 3d-scanning architectural elements inspires two questions: 1. The scale of the object is hard to grasp looking at it on a screen, which constitutes a major dimension. 2. The second question is spatiality/ the sense of space. This has always been a question of mine regarding the spatial component of AR/VR, architecture is about space even more than its physical appearance (this might be a problematic argument), I am curious about the general standpoint regarding the spatial component AR delivers/lacks.	

## History to look at: mediating architectural history for the working classes in turn of the Twentieth century Pittsburgh
It is very inspirational at the end of the piece, the building obliges historians and architects to “consider the media landscape we are facing,” especially the speed of current digital media, which is unprecedented and unimaginable in 20th century.
