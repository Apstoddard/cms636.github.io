### Additional Information gathered: 
Davis Museum:
After speaking with the Davis Museum, a NARM partner institution, we learned that "by joining Friends of Art at the Davis (FOA) at the Donor Level or higher your membership comes with reciprocal benefits at all NARM, ROAM and CUAMRP institutions". Therefore, a NARM membership is not purchased separately. 

Cuseum: We have also reached out to the founder&ceo(Brendan Ciecko) of cuseum, a software company that "creates digital solutions for museums, public attractions, and cultural nonprofits that drive visitor and member engagement through mobile technologies"; we are currently planning a meeting with Brendan.


### Current User Journey vs. Intended User Journey: 
To better visualize the curent and expected user journey, we created a diagram that can be found : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iQFVfiZEpyjjJibkPb-UcwnJXmOlE4jm-UU_W0qKHzs/edit#slide=id.g1223083890d_0_145 .


### Using data to support museum visitors: 
After receiving feedback from Debbie Douglas, we began to think about how the data could not only benefit the museums but the museum visitors as well. To support museum visitors in better understanding their museum preferences, we designed a prototype of a "Museum wrapped" user journal inspired by the year-end "Spotify wrapped" data.
