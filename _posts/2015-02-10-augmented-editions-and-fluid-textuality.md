With new tools come new capabilities. These days, thanks in part to the respective booms of computers and the Internet, people working in and studying the humanities have at their disposal a deluge of new tools: software, compilations, digital texts, and other artifacts and technologies.

One example presented in the text is the word processor. Though simple by today’s standards, this tool was a stepping stone toward a more fluid textuality. With a few keystrokes or clicks, one can copy and paste text into, out of, or around a text document; the font, size, and styling options- all mutable- offer nearly endless configurations. Instead of needing to write everything out all over to make changes, one can change a text, undo it, redo it, save different drafts, and paste segments of other texts into the document.

With the Internet came the possibility of hyperlinks to other texts or artifacts. These hyperlinks form connections between different “nodes” (eg. pages), coalescing into a web. Anyone can insert a hyperlink into their own text or website, linking to other texts or pages. The ubiquity of hyperlinks in contemporary digital knowledge-sharing on the web is obvious: just try to find a contemporary news article that does not use them.
    
In addition, blogs and other personal websites allow scholars, of both the armchair and the ivory tower varieties, to publish personal reflection on texts, whether available on the web or not, and contribute to a growing collective digital bank of fluid, textual interpretation.
