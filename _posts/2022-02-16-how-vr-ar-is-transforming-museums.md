## Cyber-Animism and Augmented Dreams

> Three dimensional AR artworks engage viewers not just as images, but as objects with an extended presence in space, especially when the artwork extends beyond the display.

AR can enrich, and even change, the entire context and dialogue of a work. For example, AR can add to what the user sees, providing additional information by annotating and adding scenes. It can also change the one-direction way of observation, highlighting connections and contrasts between the current, the past, and the foreign, an approach that plays directly into people's desire for autonomous exploration and discovery. But it is equally important to note that the use of technologies such as AR does not necessarily lead to a better experience for visitors. Designers need to create some sort of value and purpose for visitors through AR and coordinate the design and program.

## Where Stones Can Speak

Artists are always looking for new ways to express their art and connect with their audience. VR technology in museums offers these opportunities. It is a new way to communicate feelings and information and absorb them. VR may turn transitory elements of light and atmosphere into art, creating a permanent record of a transient experience. An "immersive" experience involves building psychological and emotional interactions with visitors, designing experiences that recognize their embodied, multisensory way of being in the world and giving them a true sense of agency.
