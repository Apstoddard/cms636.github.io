We have begun processing data from our survey and created some basic statistical analyses of it, but we are looking to come up with more advanced analyses and to get more data from smaller majors. We've also created some wireframe mockups of what we'd like the site to look like. We now have access to CSVs of MIT's major satisfaction, and we are looking into getting the correct formating for the alumni data.
