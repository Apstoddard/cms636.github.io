title: "More ways to play with data are better!"

I'm coming at this from a very computer science view, but what I like about this article is that it's embracing sonification partially because it can be useful, and a legitimate scientific tool, but also because it's fun to play with data in ways that the data was not meant to be used. I like the playback of the phonautogram (what a word) not because it lets us hear someone from 1860, but mostly because there was no intent for the phonautogram to ever be heard.

Playing with the playback and understanding of data is something I really enjoy. One of my favorite art installations is "[The Listening Post](http://modes.io/listening-post-ten-years-on/)," where you can sit and listen as hundreds of snippets of online conversation are spewed out. No one was ever really meant to hear the large mass of forum postings spoken out loud, but it's (in my opinion) awesome and a weird thing to imagine the conversations on the internet as actual converssations.

I think the article is a little too worried about making sure everything feels legitimate. I understand why they seem to think artists and scientists would have a hard time collaborating on sonfied data because each one puts stresses on the other. In my experience, if you call the artist a "designer" or even better a "UI/UX designer" then everyone relaxes a bit and you can pretend everything you're doing has a solid, well-thought out reason. Using sonification to represent, portray or interpret data is interesting, but because of its lack of history compared to, say, visualisation, it can be harder to get people on board because of a lack of successful examples.
