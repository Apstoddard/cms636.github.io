Augmented Reality for Architectural Experience:
A description of the issue/problem that you are trying to address:
Many museums have architectural elements that are not easily accessible or visible to the public. This can make it difficult for visitors to fully appreciate, respect, and understand the significance of the architectural aspects in relation to the collections on display. Additionally, traditional methods of interpreting architecture, such as audio guides or placards, may not provide a fully immersive and engaging experience for visitors. The central concept is to allow the visitors to virtually experience the architectural components in the display to better understand the historical, and cultural context, as well as the collections themselves. 

The envisioned audience for your project:
The primary audience for this exhibition would be museum visitors interested in architecture, design, and technology. This may include students, architects, historians, and museum-goers of all ages.

Potential museum collaborators:
The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA), MIT Museum, and the Harvard Art Museums could be potential collaborators for this exhibition. They both have collections that include architectural elements, and they also have a history of collaborating on exhibitions.
Technological/spatial/installation approach:
The exhibition would utilize augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance the visitor experience of the museum's architecture. Visitors would be able to use their smartphones or other AR devices to see virtual 3D models of architectural elements: objects including columns, arches, and ceilings, overlaid on the real-world space. The AR models could include interactive features, such as animations, audio, and text descriptions, providing visitors with a deeper understanding of the significance of the architectural elements.
I want the exhibition to be designed as a self-guided experience, allowing visitors to explore the museum's architecture at their own pace. The AR models would be triggered by markers placed throughout the museum at locations close to the collections, such as on walls, floors, or ceilings. The exhibition would also include physical installations, such as displays or models, to provide visitors with a tactile understanding of the architectural elements.
Skill sets needed for your project:
Augmented reality: This would involve creating 3D models of the architectural elements, programming the AR app, and integrating interactive features.
Architectural interpretation and visualization: This would involve researching the architectural elements included in the exhibition, developing text descriptions, and audio scripts, and creating architectural models for the physical installations.
Exhibition design: This would involve designing the physical installations, creating the layout for the markers, and ensuring that the exhibition is accessible and easy to navigate.
