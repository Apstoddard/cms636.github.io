**A description of the issue/problem that you are trying to address:**
Many museums highlight artifacts of the past to educate contemporary audiences and to shape present views through historical narratives. I’d be interested in a museum that is more future-facing in that it highlights artifacts from today to provoke thought about the future. In particular, I’d like to explore how a museum could portray current events or issues to create a space that fosters higher community engagement, respectful dialogue, and individual impact. For example, a museum I recently went to held an exhibit on global warming that used videography to capture melting glaciers. The same video could have been posted on Youtube, yet I think what made the video so compelling was how it was integrated into the space of the museum. Elements like lighting, sound, and the design of the physical space created a deeply immersive experience, and I saw people lingering or sitting down in the exhibit for much longer than the amount of time they would have spent watching the video if they had scrolled past it on their phones. 

**The envisioned audience for your project:** The audience would be the general public because I think the content would be relevant for all different demographics.

**Potential museum collaborators:** 
A collaboration with the MIT-Museum might be most fitting. It would be interesting to see what kind of research is being conducted at MIT that’s relevant to current day issues, especially research that might fuse the arts and technology (eg. at the MIT Media Lab). 

**Technological/spatial/installation approach (if part of the project):** 
Ideally, there could be a physical model for this idea, although there are a lot of moving parts, so realistically, something smaller scale might be more feasible. Perhaps different parts, such as the architectural design of the exhibit and the way that content could be displayed with technology, could be implemented individually. 

**Skill sets needed for your project:** I could foresee a diverse skill set being needed for this project, depending on what the specific topic on display is. If the main goal is to consider how to create a museum space for research or artwork that has already been created, useful skills could include design and architecture, but potentially also software skills to create digital representations of different content.
