##Cartographies of Time 

I really enjoyed the reading because it forced me to think critically about timelines, and how the idea of linearity presented itself. It is one of the patterns that we inherently recognize but have never questioned, and to imagine that once tables were the preferred method to record kingdoms.

##Analysis of Charles Minard: Russian Campaign of 1812

This is a beautiful visualization because it shows the effect of multiple factors on the march and highlights the diminishing size of the force through time, temperature by representing it geographically and directionally with their course of travel. This map highlights several things that make it a great spatial and temporal account of history. One of the main factors is the comparison that allows us to view the reducing size of the army on the march there and back on one sheet of paper. We can also simultaneously think about effects of geographic terrain, and the dropping temperature as contributions to survival rate. Although this was made years ago, I see similar trends in the info graphics that we experience today, where visual representation is complemented to minimal text to further emphasize a perspective.
