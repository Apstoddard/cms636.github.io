Maureen Whalen (Associate General Counsel, The J. Paul Getty Trust) is quoted in this reading: “If you can put it out there, does it have to be curated? If we are the portal, and we provide the content, is it terrible if it gets out there without context and without curation? Isn’t that good too?” 

If she is insinuating that “it is good too”, I think I disagree. Simply putting content “out there” does not fulfill the same role as curated content with context and direction provided. One reason I like to go to museums and even curated websites is because I don’t have to do a ton of leg work to find an interesting topic and what to think about when looking at a specific topic — things I think curations helps the reader/audience to do. Let’s take Wikipedia for example. I’d argue that Wikipedia is heavily uncurated. Sure the hyperlinks within the text help direct you to other (perhaps) relevant topics, but it doesn’t really give you any starting points because you have to know what you are looking for in the first place. What I like about curation is that you place trust in someone more knowledgeable about a topic than you are and they present in an interesting and organized fashion, the information you are curious about and the context in which people can think about it. 

That said, I don’t think that there is anything wrong with putting everything out there, on the internet, while having a physical museum where the information is curated. Or if something is not physically based, to have a curated site/platform/app but then make the data available in the form of databases. This would be an acceptable dissemination of information without having to lose out on the option to see curated information.   

Another point that I thought was interesting was the idea of community. As far as museums and libraries relate to community aspects, I think that libraries are already a place for community building (at least in my hometown and I think in Boston/Cambridge) while museums are often places for a more niche audience and something one does with a small group and not with the intention of interacting with others. For example, my hometown library offers community movie screenings, reading groups, and summer programs for kids. On the other hand, there are two museums in my hometown and you have to pay to get into both and they are mostly a tourist destination — not somewhere locals would gather together.
