## Layering and separation

Effective layering of information can be challenging. An important consideration should be given to the relationship of information represented in both visual and content.
Unlayered visual representation fail to communicate the ideas. 
A grid helps in the general reading of the information as long as it is muted and represented in a way that doesn’t overwhelm the reading of the actual data. 
The 1+1=3 concept underlines the importance of the space formed as a consequence of two lines and how it affects the reading.

I totally agree with the way he defines ”information” in relation to “differences” in layers and the way we separate the data that help in the reading and the conveying of the message. The cluttering and incoherent display of data can lead to disinformation and false perception from the readers specially if they are not familiar with the topic conveyed.
