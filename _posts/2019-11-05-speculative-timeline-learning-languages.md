title: 'Speculative Timeline: Learning Languages'
author: Seo Yeon (Rachel) Kwak
---
My speculative timeline depicts my level of comfort speaking the languages I have learned so far.

A traditional timeline lacks in illustrating this because of various reasons, including that it is biased towards homogenous information (about one language rather than for multiple languages, in this case), information that is structured into specific points or nodes in time (rather than a spectrum throughout the full timeline), and concrete precise information (rather than relative and subjective). 

The information I want to represent accounts for multiple "tracks", is a spectrum throughout the full length of time I am considering, and is subjective to my perspective. Therefore, I created a sort of hybrid density + bar graph to show how my comfort level for each language has changed over time, with relevant points in time marked.
