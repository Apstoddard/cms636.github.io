## Interdisplinary Projects Platform

The idea for this project is developing a web platform where artists will be able to collaborate and create interdisciplinary projects with other artists. Musicians, visual artists, graphic designers, dancers, and the like will be able to upload their creations and have others add on to to them via various mediums. Artists will also be able to see othersâ€™ creations and be inspired to contribute to them as well. The basic question that this too is trying to answer is how can artists collaborate with others when they might not the physical/social access to other artists of various mediums. The data for the project will be created by the people who use the platform. The idea would most likely start out as a web platform, but possibly could be translated to a mobile application as well.
