title: Digital Memory and the Archive by Wolfgang Ernst
author: Ao Li

Honestly speaking, there are many terminologies in the given excerpts that I'm not at all familiar with, like "media archaeology","media art","microarchives" etc, there is an absence of context in my mental library which renders the text confusing to me.In this three exerpts, I didn't see direct description about how classical archivists work with archive(maybe this is discussed in other parts of the book), and this gives me the impression of disregarding the work being done by classically trained archivists in the fields of media preservation and web archiving. Also, Wolfgang heavily focuses on the ontological and epistemological level,which shows a bit indifference toward applied disciplines highly relevant to media and archives and an unwillingness to re-contextualize his media-driven analyses into more human contexts. Yet, I can still get a general idea of the excerpts that the digitization of archive is minimizing  the spatial and and temporal scale of the archiving into differential level, making the inherent storage function of archive more and more transient, storage is nothing but a limit value of transfer, the traditional separation between transmission media and storage media becomes obsolete.
