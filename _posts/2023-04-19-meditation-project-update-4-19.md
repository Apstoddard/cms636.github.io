title: Meditation project update 4/19
author: Livia

- Reached out to Debbie - thinking about how to incorporate current cool Exchange animations / projections into this project since I'm not an op art design kid
- I've decided which meditative practices I want to show, and worked on their presentation: 

Introduction to MIT Firehose Culture (1 minute)
Where meditation stands (1 minute)
Guided 2 minute practice (random)
-   Grounding: Ujjayi breath (Darth Vader breathing)
- 	Exploratory: Following the breath
- 	Open awareness: Watch the mind
- 	Focus: Watch the candle
Closing statement (1 minute)

Currently writing up scripts for each section. This week, will record audio narration + guided practices (by me unless I find a volunteer with a really nice voice, otherwise... I might have to make some magic on Audacity...).
Then, will start creating simple animations for looping slide deck for background.
Next week, make animations for guided meditations

- Question: I'm really good at using powerpoint for animations and stuff (figured it out sometime in elementary school?). I don't think that's how people do things in industry. Recommendations on simple software to use for animations / graphics / videos? I'm thinking big blocks, translations, stuff that I could've done with powerpoint. 
Also debating between making animations for guided meditations and filming myself- thoughts?
