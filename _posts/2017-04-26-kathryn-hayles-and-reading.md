title: Kathryn Hayles and Reading
---
It took me awhile to understand what Hayles was talking about as I read her piece on close, hyper, and machine reading. It was definitely targeted to people with a working definition of close reading because the piece never gives a clear answer on what that is. The best definition I can come up with is "reading, with close attention paid to literary techniques and concepts". Close reading involves thinking about and looking for themes, intent, and rhetorial devices in the text. The definitions Hayles quotes are laughably nebulous. One "more specific" definition she gives is "a modern academic practice with an inaugural moment, a period of development, and now perhaps a period of decline." This says absolutely nothing about what close reading is. The same could be said about Mendelian genetics or many, many other practices, but they aren't close reading. I don't know why Hayles included this confusing and unhelpful definitions.
