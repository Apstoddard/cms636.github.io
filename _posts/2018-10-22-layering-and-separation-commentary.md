title: Layering and Separation Commentary

The main arguments purported in Chapter 3 of Edward Tufte: Envisioning Information regarding the power of layering and separation to streamline data are:

- to be wary of the 1 + 1 = 3 effect, which is when two elements in close proximity create an interaction that can be obtrusive and adds noise
- to utilize shape, value, weight, and especially color effectively to create distinction / layering
- to avoid strong lining and gridding which is loud, data-“imprisoning”, and closes off white space
- to subtract weight where possible, activating negative/white space

When it comes to the specific strategies and examples illustrated, I agree with most of them - especially the shape, value, weight, color, and lining examples. I have actually always followed these strategies subconsciously in all my design work. However, I do not necessarily agree with the 1 + 1 = 3 argument, because I think it is not always necessarily a detriment. I believe there are cases in which the "incidental by-products"/interactions that arise can be positively utilized - for example, I have often wanted to purposely create white space, to create the "3" out of "1 + 1". Like in the map example with the Rhein river labeling, I personally found the first box to be the most legible because of the white space created under the text, which is a practice I have used myself.
