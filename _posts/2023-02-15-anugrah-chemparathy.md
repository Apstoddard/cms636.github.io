Anugrah Chemparathy is a junior at MIT majoring in Computer Science. At MIT heâ€™s interested in applied math, machine learning, and a little bit of algorithms. He loves building random things and has been doing origami since he was in elementary school. Also he also enjoys casually thinking about interior decor and coming up with ways to improve the day-to-day useability and aesthetic of the lounge near his dorm room.
