  - The Database

Although this was by far one of our longest readings, I very much enjoyed it. Thinking about the tension and commonalities between database and narrative was very interesting. I am biased, but I perceive the database to represent objectivity, diversity of thought, opportunity for exploration, and documentation of implicit/perceived connections. I perceive narrative as traditional, pre-digested thought, explicit, intangible, and undocumented means of explanation that often hides its own curation and crafting. A database is self-revealing. However, databases can be as rigid as a narrative, when framed in a particular way or when the user is given a few amount of queries. Data visualizations can great entrances into exploring the aesthetics and flexibilities of databases.

However, narratives and databases need not be contentious; they do often exist as hybrids. Both are spaces for exploration and understanding. They face similar limitations: depending on framing and structure, they can live on a spectrum between perceived objectivity and subjectivity. In the best case scenario, we can see the semantic mapping, networks, database, association trails that came together to form the narrative as a sort of hypernarrative. In addition, any one path through a database (that follow semantic meaning and logic) could also be considered a narrative. 

I’m studying computer-generated and procedural art for my UROP this semester, so I was struck by the idea of a “database complex.” It seems that in rebellion to the cult of the individual, we have come to a completely different perspective. Nake, and other Algorists, believed that computer art is all about math bringing order and generating natural aesthetic states algorithmically. This related to our traditional understanding of databases as a metaphor for a guided search of all possible narratives and perspectives. The Algorist Manfred Mohr once said, “creative work is an algorithm which represents human behavior in a given situation.” Perhaps a narrative is the creative work representing one means of human analysis in a given situation.

This relates to Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera. In montage, like other generative artists, he seeks to explore all perspectives and film techniques to reveal truth with the kino-eye.  As beings taught to chronologize and compartmentalize, Vertov challenges us the same way the unstructured,  limitless database that is the world challenges us. He brings discomfort in the viewers by mixing of the special and sad moments (marriage, divorce, pain, death, sickness, and birth). It’s all a part of life unceasing and simultaneous. From underneath trains and in moving cars , he shows “everything” to reveal the sociopolitical atmosphere. However, the film does not hide its own curation, which is really important.

In my interest for open knowledge and diversity of thought, I prefer my narratives to be more like databases. However, I feel databases today have a lot of work to do to allow flexibility of thought and to improve discoverability of data. Data visualization and spatial humanities are definitely steps in the right direction.
