I liked the personal feel of this paper. From Catherine Evans concise but well-thought out examples, I could see her care for her work of creating inviting, insightful spaces. I liked her concept of "connectors" where visitors could interact and reflect on materials. From an administrative point of view, this is a fantastic opportunity to blend modern technology and museum exhibits. However, from an engineer's perspective, it feels like participatroy technology could lead to disaster. So many different inputs have to be mitigated, and the systems have to be maintained through continuous daily use. I want to add a layer of consideration: how can we create interactive spaces that are exciting and relevant but don't abuse excessive overhead of technology? For example, do we have to use AR or could we put up a board of sticky notes for people to leave their thoughts?
