title: The Future of Sonification
---
I find sonification to be an interesting field that has a lot of potential to be explored. I feel like many of the current applications of sonification try to map data values and quantities directly to another aspect of music that is quantifiable, such as pitches. However, in many cases these sonifications of data can turn out slightly arbitrary or irrelevant, and while they might be artistically expressive, they could turn out to be unhelpful in terms of providing another perspective or answer regarding the data. As a musician, I feel particularly attached to sounds and music -- hearing certain background noises can recreate an atmosphere (such as a coffee shop or the T station), and hearing certain songs and voices can trigger poignant memories and emotions. I think there is still so much potential in sonification, and I can see it particularly adding a very valuable emotional aspect to data that is currently lacking in todayâ€™s data representations.
