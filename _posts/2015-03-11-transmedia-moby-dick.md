I think that once the _Moby Dick_ data is cleaned up a bit with metadata incorporated to decide if a location was simply mentioned or if it was a place that characters went/events took place, this could be really cool for a new form of audio (visual) books. 

As someone is listening to the story, there could be a sort of animation, triggered at certain points in the narrative (namely, when a location is mentioned) that shows, say a ship for Moby Dick, travel to the new destination on a map. This could be a cool way of incorporating transmedia material, if we could do it in a way or at a time when it wouldn’t be too disruptive to the story. For example, let’s say Character A travels with his crew from England to South Africa, the animation would show the ship sailing (just to set the tone for the transmedia experience) and then once they’ve arrived at the destination, a sort of captains log or side story of one of the other characters at that location (the possibilities are endless), could appear to the side, so that the reader/listener can further explore the story world. This could also be a place to insert opportunities to discover more about the historical context and relevance to the story of the location. I have nowhere near the technical background to even know where to start doing this, so hopefully my description will suffice.
