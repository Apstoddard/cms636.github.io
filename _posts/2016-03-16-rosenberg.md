This reading really made me think about how we generate visualizations for concepts and data and how those visualizations then shape how we think about the data. Since I have always been exposed to timelines that are linear, with a clear scale and one event follows the next, I haden't really thought to ask how else time can be visualized.
I found it fascinating that the visualization of time as a line is a fairly recently invention.
