## Olympic ArtMap Project Update: May 3

**Metadata** (Ece and Miles): We've continued to comb through the exhibition catalogues to add city information for entries. We've now completed 1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936. 1948 is all that remains, and we'll be done with that shortly.

**Static Content for Demos** (Miles): Following discussion last week, I've added a few artworks/stories to the Demo side of the site, so that there's now at least one entry/story per Olympic year. There are 8 pages altogether. I've also used some historical, public-domain maps from oldmapsonline.org and I've added dashed lines or arrows to them to illustrate the trajectories of various artworks. These images will accompany the text
