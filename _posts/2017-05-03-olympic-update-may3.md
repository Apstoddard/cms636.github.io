## Olympic ArtMap Project Update: May 3

**Metadata** (Ece and Miles): We've continued to comb through the exhibition catalogues to add city information for entries. We've now completed 1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936. 1948 is all that remains, and we'll be done with that shortly.

**Static Content for Demos** (Miles): Following discussion last week, I've added a few artworks/stories to the Demo side of the site, so that there's now at least one entry/story per Olympic year. There are 8 pages altogether. I've also used some historical, public-domain maps from oldmapsonline.org and I've added dashed lines or arrows to them to illustrate the trajectories of various artworks. These images will accompany the text

**Design for Landing Page** (Miles and Yuchuan): In response to the class's suggestion, we've attempted to make the use of the Olympic rings more obvious, while avoiding a design that treads on IOC copyright. Miles put together an initial concept, and Yuchuan cleaned up the look and reformatted it for screen size.

**Design for Demo Page** (Yuchuan and Kelsey):



**Possible Design for Famous Cases Page** (Yuchuan): Last week, we tested out the idea of having a filter for particularly famous artists. It became clear in the class discussion that this label "fame" is hard to defend/justify, so for now we've removed the filter, but we're still thinking about ways we might incorporate this element of the metadata for interested users. Here's a possible side-page concept for looking at famous artists and entries.
