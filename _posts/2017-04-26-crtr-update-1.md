As we decided last week, this first week of worth has focused mainly on larger-scale design. On that front the team has made progress both on the proposed UX of the project and on background research and planning of the implementation.

### Backend
- [Github repository](https://github.com/peterldowns/crtr) to contain the code.
- A fair amount of research into the potential implementation. [Results here](https://github.com/peterldowns/crtr/blob/master/README.md). Although we considered using Javascript on both the backend and the frontend, there is much less of an existing ecosystem for machine learning techniques in Javascript. Given our team's equal familiarity and experience with Javascript and Python, and the availability of open source Python code to meet our system's goals, we'll be using a Python backend and a Javascript frontend.

### Frontend
We thought hard about the user experience and the desired functionality, and came up with a first draft of the UX:
