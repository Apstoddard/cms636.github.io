**Project Idea 1: History of Alphabets**

One project idea is to develop an interface that allows people to learn about the history and information behind different alphabets. This project would require an API that returns information about specified alphabets (such as [this one](http://spellout.org/api#alphabets)), which can also be combined with other kinds of data such as images that can add more enriching information. The intended audience is academics interested in linguistics, and the main purpose of the project would be to support research and/or study in written language. The core question being addressed is: what can we learn about the history of written languages?

**Miscellaneous Ideas**

Another concept I am interested in is how languages intertwine with one another. For example, a project idea is to map how different languages have influenced one another and thus create a web of languages. However, I'm not sure how this can be technically implemented... 

There are many other general themes such as music, dance, fashion, and art that I would like to brainstorm about more in order to develop viable project ideas.
