This reframe acknowledges the displacement of the artifact and tries to highlight the piece as it would be in its original context. The added visuals in the description and around the piece successfully help the viewer envision how this artifact was meant to be displayed. The visual around the artifact is quite basic though, and I’m wondering if AR technology could be used to enhance seeing the artifact in its entirety as opposed to simply a sketch.

This ReFrame directly addresses the viewer and asks them to consider the full sensory experience that would have occurred when seeing this piece in its original placement in a tomb rather than a museum. This is an attempt to honor the piece’s original context, though this attempt is lacking in a description of how the piece was acquired. There are also a few ways to expand on just a description of the sensory experience of viewing the artifact in its tomb, such as through AR technology or even fully recreating some of the described surroundings.

This piece and its description really interested me, and I believe there is a lot of room for exploration with a ReFrame sign. First, the sign references the works of Jackson Pollock and  abstract expressionism. I would love to see this piece visually compared to those; perhaps there could be a screen with similar paintings / ones Snyder took inspiration from and viewers could annotate the pieces with where they saw similarities. Further, I would love to hear more about how painting ties in with “feminist struggles for equality” and how painting allowed Snyder to “speak visually . . . in a male dominated world.” I think seeing this piece in context of her other pieces / other pieces that address similar themes could be interesting and give room for a further exploration about how such an abstract piece is tied to feminism.
