Ernst’s writing, or its translation at least, seems to focus more on aesthetics than on practicality. All three essays share complex terminology and a generally confusing structure. Like others, I found the text to be a slow read because of this.

The essays focus on the structure of digital archives as opposed to the material contained within. By considering the nature of the digital archive, Ernst takes an interesting approach to studying new media. He emphasizes the dynamic nature of digital archives, and argues that they constitute new “cybernetic beings.” While archives can take on many different forms, especially in the digital age, I wonder if this is an extreme view to take.

However, I do agree that modern day archives are both less static than those in the past and subject to mathematical principles. Because of this (and general curiosity) the notion of aesthetics as a “ratio between order and complexity” was striking. The archive as new art idea is one that could be extended to include multiple technological systems.
