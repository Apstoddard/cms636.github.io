She has worked as a journalist and videographer, documentary-maker, and prior to coming to Harvard she managed a newsroom for APTN, Canadaâ€™s Indigenous broadcaster. Preferred journalism beats are politics and human rights. She has a BA in journalism and an MA in History. Karyn is sensitive about sharing her itunes playlist, because she fears judgment over her often questionable choices.-![Karyn Pugliese]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Pugliese%20headsht-1.jpg)
