title: Adding SeaChart to Moby Dick Mapping

One of the ideas I became interested in pursuing when looking at the Moby Dick Maps was whether shipping charts would add to the given visualization. Luckily, there were several additional Maury Charts given to us to work with. I tried overlaying the Atlantic, next to the Americas and the Pacific, adjacent to Asia.

I did not find that this chart added a large amount of insight to the data, so further examination of the text would be necessary to make this more useful.

###Map of Pacific###

This map helps me understand the visualization better as the routes connect the location dots on the map.

I think the whaling chart can add additional info by mapping the paths followed in the book. Additionally, we discussed the problem of generalized locations (Pacific Ocean, Mighigan, etc) and at least concerning the areas in water or along the coast, these charts could give a more logical location for the data points, such as along the provided routes.
