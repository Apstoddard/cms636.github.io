Electronic displays are a common way to add digital information to a space. Museums may use electronic displays to support their exhibits. Based on Manovich’s writing, I think that two ways electronic displays can be used are to immerse visitors in supplemental content, or to augment the main content. 

For example, consider the Prada store Manovich mentions. The goal is to sell the image of the “Church of Prada”. The Prada Atlas is one means of accomplishing this task. Since it presents many details and is interactive, users must periodically divert their attention from the remainder of the store to engage with the atlas. In this way, the Prada Atlas is immersive. Manovich also mentions small screens in the Prada store which play ephemeral images. Although these screens don’t provide detailed content, they are critical in establishing the atmosphere of the store. Even though they are “in the background”, they make an impact on the visitor, just like the Prada Atlas does.

With this example, we should think carefully when introducing an electronic display into a museum exhibit. What purpose should it serve? Should it capture the user’s attention and invite them to interact with it? Or should it work to enhance the exhibit while avoiding the spotlight itself? Both approaches have merit and can improve a visitor’s museum experience in different ways.
