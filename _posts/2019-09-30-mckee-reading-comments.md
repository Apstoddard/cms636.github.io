-## A New Post
McKee text is proposing that texts are interpreted – or should be – culturally, as culture helps explain certain values, concepts, reasoning, tastes  etc that cannot necessarily be understood from another culture. 
He suggests texts can be interpreted 3 ways: realist – who would describe different cultures in terms of superior inferior, a structuralist who would look for commonalities, and his position a post-structuralist (himself) who sees the differences but does not look for a superior way of interpreting reality nor commonality but accepts that different cultures interpret the world differently. He is laying out a methodology for this that we don’t completely discover by the end of the chapter. 
His method, itself is very western and so I am not sure how he reconciles that. 
I was most interested in his way of describing cultures: youth, nationality/ethnicity/ gender (not sure he brought up class) and the change in culture over time. I am wondering how he eventually reconciles cross over, at what point a difference of say gender or youth doesn’t necessarily create a subset in an interpretation.
