title: Final Project Interests - Trudy Painter
author: Trudy Painter
---
I hope I'm doing this right... But I'm writing about final projects I am interested in.

I'm interested in both Derek and Devin's web approach to an museum exhibit. I think my "Discovery Cartography" concept could be integrated in Devin's web of stories project for EC. And, I think I could work with Derek to further ideas of digital personalization of visitors' museum experiences.
