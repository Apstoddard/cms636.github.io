**Design is Storytelling**  

The reading expressed that design is a combination of rational problem solving and emotional storytelling. Storytelling is powerful because it has the “potential to transfer information into someone else’s mind”; it is essentially a mode of delivering knowledge. As the reading describes Dorothy’s journey in the story Wizard of Oz, it concludes that  “She goes home to Kansas with new knowledge”. The knowledge gained from Dorothy’s time in the Emerald City is a direct outcome of the accumulation of events that she has experienced. Similarly, when designing the user journey in a museum, it is important to design so that the accumulation of small interactions come together so that the user can go home with new knowledge. Furthermore, thinking about how the new knowledge can work as a catalyst for the next learning expereince is an essential part of designing an effective journey. 



**Digital Storytelling**

A well designed product or service is so seamlessly integrated into the user journey that it can go unnoticed. Similarly, when technology is incorporated in a museum exhibition, it should be used as a tool to enhance the story and content that the museum is trying to convey. A point that stood out to me was, “Focus on the goals of an experience, not on specific means of delivery or key technologies”. Because technology is quickly evolving, there may be pressure to constantly adapt and incorporate new tools. However, it’s an important reminder to think about why these tools are being used in the first place. The reading reminded me of a lot of ‘immersive museums’ that are popular today. Although there is no right or wrong answer, it made me curious about whether museums can just be a space for pure entertainment.
