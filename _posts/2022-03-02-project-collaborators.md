I thought the project discussion was very fruitful. I am happy to collaborate with everyone in class. The two projects that I am most interested in are: 
1) Incorporation of some NFC/RFID experience with sound or other media (potentially working with Camilla, Derek or Trudy). I see many similarities and I am not married to the platform idea, I'm open to exploring other avenues
 2) Application of AR to distort/interact with art pieces in the musuem (potentially working with Xiaoyi or Yunsong). I like both ideas and I think there are avenues to expand 
 
Looking forward to working with everyone :)
