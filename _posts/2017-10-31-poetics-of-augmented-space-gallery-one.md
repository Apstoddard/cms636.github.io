title: Poetics of Augmented Space & Gallery One

I thought it interesting how much broader Manovich's interpretation of "Augmented" space/reality is than our current definition, which is mostly a smartphone centric/ Pokemon Go-esque experience. Though it fits the formal definition of augmented space as defined by Manovich, Gallery One would not be what most people think of when they picture "augmented reality" in present day. With the advent of the smartphone AR games/experiences, I think, by how Manovich describes augmented space, there should be a distinction between augmented space and augmented reality, rather than augmented reality being a subcategory of augmented space. In this distinction, Gallery One would be augmented space as Manovich describes, whereas our current day smartphone apps (Pokemon Go, snapchat, etc.) are augmented reality.
