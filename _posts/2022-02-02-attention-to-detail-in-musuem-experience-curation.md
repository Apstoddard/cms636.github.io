## Topic: The Musuem as a Holistic Experience: Lascaux IV 

The readings this week reiterated the importance of a musuem’s responsibility towards visitors and its community. It is interesting to note that one of the key pain points mentioned in the in-class activity on Tuesday was central in the experience design of the new Lascaux musuem “being pushed and rushed by others”. The example of the disappointed child highlighted the intricate work required to curate a seamless musuem experience - attention to detail is a key task for curators & developers alike.  
The responsibility towards the visitors can be described as the combination of a curated customer journey “experience”, a clear story and educational elements, an exquisite yet intentional spatial formulation, an invitation to enjoy, imagine and speculate; and finally avenues to participate in knowledge creation. The community effectively leverages the aforementioned elements however can benefit greatly from flexibility, impact generation and welcoming spirits / people of relevance & closeness as mentioned by Nina Simone in her TED talk. That being said, it is important to note the amount of work, effort and expertise required to bring these promises to life. In the case of Lascaux, a museum that has created a successful benchmark of experience delivery, upwards of thirty agencies  with diverse expertise were involved. In my opinion, the task of delivering a successful musuem experience will become increasingly difficult as people expect more, are not easily entertained and develop more attention to detail. This made me recall an experience I had in London were the musuem floor was squeaking and my entire experience was ruined by that minor inconvenience. A question that kept going through my mind is to what level of detail should musuem curate the experience? what happens when that inconvenience is in the musuem’s technology offering (like glitchy screens for example)? Should they leave room for more spontaneity or should they employ tactics to direct a visitor’s every move? For now, they should definitely have less noisy floors at least.
