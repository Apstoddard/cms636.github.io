## Edward Tufte, _Envisioning Information_, "Color and Information"

Tufte's fundamental uses of color was a useful breakdown:
- to label (color as noun)
- to measure (color as quantity)
- to represent or imitate reality (color as representation)
- to enliven or decorate (color as beauty)

I agree with most of his comments, especially his belief that one should be able to defend one's designs by providing reasons for choices against arbitrary taste preferences. However, some of his examples for "color clutter" displayed a very straight-laced view of beauty. It disregarded some of the more austere or dissonant examples, but arguably this is rather subjective and show an alternative version of beauty.  

As for the examples, I especially enjoyed Oliver Byrne's color diagrams from _The Six Books of the Elements of Euclid_. They were beautiful, simple, and legible.

## Edward Tufte, _Envisioning Information_, "Narratives of Time and Space"

Immediately after finishing Tufte's chapter on Time and Space, I wondered how he might currently respond to this line, "At every screen are two powerful information-processing capabilities: human and computer. Yet all communication between the two must pass through low-res display." With technological advancements, it is not quite easy to create dynamic, high resolution renderings of time and space. The larger question, I believe, is should we? With such an influx of data, what are ways to display this content without falling into the trap of large, swirling, nebulous displays that have become such a trope of the digital era.  

In this modern age, how can we maintain some of the restraint used in some of the examples Tufte has shown. The reduction of Zorn's _Grammar of the Art of Dancing_ is also quite powerful because it closely mirrors the musical notations above. Immediately, it reminded me of Francesco Cangiullo's _Caff√©-concerto_. It would be interesting to reimagine these for the "high-resolution" age.

## Stephen Few, _The Chartjunk Debate_

While I do agree with Few's argument, I believe that his retort as well as Tufte's "chartjunk" explanation are too loosely defined. From a design perspective, it is obvious that what Few describes as "embellishments" can become a distinctive element of graphs or charts. Some examples he has provided, such as Holmes's Steel Dynamics poster, are meant to portray the concept graphically, rather than act as a legible graph. 

Tufte notes that "chartjunk" does not involve artistic considerations and is used to describe the non-data or redundant elements in a graph (such as hash marks). Few's suggestion to categorize the different types of chartjunk can create a framework for this "non-data".
