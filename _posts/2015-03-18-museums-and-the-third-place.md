I was most interested in the idea of a museum or library as “third place”, a space for people to congregate and learn that is neither their home nor their workplace.  I think the future of museums and libraries as institutions hinges on how they leverage and define a third place.  I liked the idea of creating a digital “third place” for individuals to converse and congregate, and how, moving forward, libraries and museums can merge this physical and digital space.  This intertwining of the more easily accessible and digital third place with the expanse and resources of a library or museum can have huge potential for education and community building.  I think it would be interesting to have online communities to collaboratively curate there own online exhibitions, and then perhaps exhibit a number of those works within a gallery setting.  

Growing up, I often visited the library on the weekend and would see museum exhibitions with my family.  Throughout my childhood, the libraries and museums’ novelty lay in their otherness.  It was a destination, somewhere I could go by myself, with friends, or with family to break the monotony of daily routine, which exists mostly in the home or school and work.  

Wellesley has a museum, the Davis Museum, very close on our campus, and I covet my visits to the museum.  I frequent the museum now more than ever, not because of new exhibits being shown, but because the museum provides a great, well-lit workplace, and when I grow tired of my work I can retreat into the gallery for a study break.  I think in this way, the Davis Museum has done an extraordinary job of embracing the idea of a “third place”, by providing an open, social, and relaxed area in the lobby for quiet study, and thus the facilities are more utilized.
