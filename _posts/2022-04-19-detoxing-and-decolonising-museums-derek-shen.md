I admire the message and intention of Museum Detox and BAME. I love how throughout the article they challenge even the buzzwords of the present, like "diversity", and elevate their actions to "activism" and "decoloniality". I also love how adamant BAME is with the notion that fighting systemic racism in the world of museums _must_ surpass just "representation", and is a "complex set of ideas" rooted in change that is activated by "space, money, and time". Often, I feel that commitments to "diversity", especially at the corporate/institution level, are rather shallow and feel more like virtue signalling than anything else. Being so transparent with the ideas that "most of them (BAME) have ended the process feeling no more optimistic about the feasibility of decolonising museums but are empowered to discuss their engagement with museums in a more detailed and reflective way", is in itself more responsible than just a surface-level commitment to diversity. Finally, I think the acceptance of the difference roles of both "Insider" and "Outsider" activists is admirable, it made me realize how thorough and critical this process has been in fighting for change in museum spaces.
