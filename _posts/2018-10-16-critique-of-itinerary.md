title: Critique of Itinerary

Itinerary is a tool to combine timeline data with geographic data.

## Advantages

- Itinerary can be used for literary data and nearly any map, such as "A Frightful Number!" documenting plague counts in the Netherlands.
- It can overlay multiple maps to compare different visulaizations of geographical space, potentially at different times.
- It can depict regions, points, and paths, which all have different physical implications that are not always communicated in data visualizations.
- It allows us to see alternate paths, making it clear that the data is not clear.

## Limitations

- Itinerary does not accurately portray the time between events, makking it difficult to fully understand the story behind them.
- The visual alone does not portray time clearly; it requires clicking through it  to understand ordering.
- There is limited use of color, and when it is used, there is little to no clear meaning as to why.
- There is little connection between the visualization and the meaning of a particular point-the heart/story of the data remains in simply reading the words below.
