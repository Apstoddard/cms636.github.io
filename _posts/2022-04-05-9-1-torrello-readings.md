Torello analyzes specific case studies of buildings and installations to explore museum spaces + archives. 

Questions:
- The Plaster Recast AR is jaw-dropping. It's an awesome example of fluid interaction that adds rich context to the physical recasts. However, I'm sure that this fluidity was difficult to acheive. What challenges did you run into designing this app? Would you make an app like this again?
- With the inclusion of a digital app, the sky opens up for further content exploration. The abundance of material can be overwhelming for new visitors, and some level of curation is still necessary to create a cohesive narrative. How did you decide what material to include in the app? Do you think that all digital archivalia should be available to the public?
