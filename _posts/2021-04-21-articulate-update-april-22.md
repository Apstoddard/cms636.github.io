title: ARticulate update April 22

**Background and research**



**UI/UX**
Based on feedback from classmates and from MFA staff, we updated our UI/UX to prompt the user to add personal info tags such as age when they first use the app, tag their response with content identifiers, and filter responses via the tags. The current Figma prototype can be accessed [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/qWZ8ITvQK8M2P9pIW4IeyA/ARticulate?node-id=9%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1). 

We recently decided that users cannot respond to initial responses via text, but rather only via emoji reacts in order to decrease the amount of moderation needed. We plan to update the wireframe accordingly, and continue discussing ways to streamline the interface.
