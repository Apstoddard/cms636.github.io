-As a curator, what sort of access do you have to the history of some of the objects you curate, such as those in the “Memory Unearthed” Exhibit
-In the “Memory Unearthed” Exhibit, it is mentioned that more than half of Ross’s original 6,000 photos made it past Lodz’s liberation. How many of those did you have access to, and how did you choose which to include in the exhibit?
-How do you “tune in” to the response to your exhibits or evaluate their “success” after they go up?
