## "How are museums using artificial intelligence, and is AI the future of museums?", L. Styx

This article really opened my eyes to the broad range of uses that AI could have in a museum. I am particularly drawn to the idea of using AI to increase accessibility for museums, whether it is determining visitor capacity flux for increased ticket release or facilitating a natural flow of traffic through the museum exhibits curated through understanging of general population sentiments towards pieces. I think my hesitations surrounding AI are based in individual data tracking and "customization" that keeps people reliant on technology and draws them away from their physical environment and in-person interactions. As discussed previously, there is a fine line between engaging and engulfing a visitor's attention (e.g., museum goal vs social media goal) that can be easily crossed no matter the intention. Balancing also between interactive and gimmicky is also important when looking at physical uses of AI, such as helper robots like Pepper (at select Smithsonians).
