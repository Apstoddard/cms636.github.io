title: "Keeley - Potential Scam Message Idea"
---

I was considering a dynamic visualization with a bipartite screen. On the left side is a bare-bones, anonymous representation of a scammer, and on the right side is some equally indistinguishable representation of a mark. The visualization could then be launched and some representation for a message would be sent from the Nigerian scammer to the mark. As this message sends, it illuminates some aspect of the initially fully anonymous scammer representation (i.e. if the message alludes to the scammer being a prince, the representation gains a crown, etc). The message is recevied by the mark representation on the right hand side, and that representation also becomes more defined. Messages ping pong between the two sides of the screen, at each iteration further illuminating more and more about each of the interacting parties.

The evolution would represent two distinct viewpoints: the scammer as imagined by the mark, and the mark as imagined by the scammer. At the end of the string of interactions, both representations revert to their true state, from what has been imagined. The visualization shows the false perceptions in a scam interaction, and how an interaction develops over time.
