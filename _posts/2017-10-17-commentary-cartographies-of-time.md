I thought it was really interesting how Rosenberg's work compared to Bodenhamer's. Rosenberg seems to demonstrate that spatial mapping can bring to life otherwise uninteresting data and Bodenhamer thought that technologies like GIS strip data of its inherent emotion. To consile these differences, I think that compared to just looking at a list of dates and events, spatial mapping can tell the story of a sequence of events but not so perfectly that they capture the stories of their time.
