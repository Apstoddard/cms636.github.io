title: Curatorship as Social Practice
---


I’ve been to a lot of museums before. The MoMA, the National Gallery, the LACMA, the MET, major museums in London, in Paris, in India, in Israel, in Toronto, and more. My mother is a strong believe that in order to have a good conversation you need to be educated in all regards. But the favorite museum that I’ve ever visited is the Art Basel Expo, that happens every year a little over two hours from my house. Technically, Art Basel isn’t a museum. It’s a big convention that happens in only two locations in the entire world, Miami, Florida, and Basel, Switzerland for about a week. However, every major and upcoming artist is there showing off pieces, whether they’re dead or alive. I’ve been twice, as my high school was fortunate enough to be able to send some students to go visit each year. I think that Art Basel does art presentation right though. Technically the presentation of art isn’t done or curated by one group of people. There are booths of sorts that people come and set up to display art, and each individual booth has its own unique style and unique pieces. They have figured out how to curate their art to everyone who visits. They’ve adapted extremely well. The focus of the paper this week was exactly this: how are museums adapting the art of showing art to the changing society. The one thing that Art Basel doesn’t do right, and that I’ve found many other museums don’t do right is give the right amount of detail. There is only so much that the little placards next to a painting or sculpture can say. But what is missing is the true story of why is this painting important, what is its story, how did it get from the artist to the museum, what makes it worthy of being hung up next to other artists? These are just my opinions, however everyone is entitled to their own.
