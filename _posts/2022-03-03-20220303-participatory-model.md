## _The Impact of the Participatory, Visitor-Centered Model on Curatorial Practice_, C. Evans
  
  Though the idea of participation is not new, the shift of museums attempting to rediscover a balance in their curation was so interesting. Creating a visitor-centered model really first centers around the collaboration of the curators/team to build something cohesive and spectacular. The balance as well of curating an exhibit with both a general populus engagement aspect and a scholarly aeshtetic in mind, truly does require consideration of "who is the museum for?" The two seem to be at great odds, but is there a way for these two ideas to be united? Can there be an exhibition created that maximizes on both scholarly reputation and consumer engagement? This reminds me of the immersive experiences (Van Gogh, Frida Khalo, etc.) that appeal to the layman but are underwhelming for scholars and those who have appreciated the real art before. Perhaps there is no way to maximize both of these conflicting ideas; museums must rely on collaborations with varying skill sets and views to find a happy medium.
