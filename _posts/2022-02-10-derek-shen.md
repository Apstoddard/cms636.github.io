Derek is currently a third year undergraduate at MIT studying Computer Science and Economics. He has interests in machine learning and data visualization, with hopes of using those methods to bring solutions to the public sector, specifically in the disaster relief industry. Outside of the classroom, he can be found competing for MIT Men's Tennis, chasing personal records in Minesweeper, or talking to his curator sister who he is always eager to share his CMS.636 findings with.
