Title: Your Museum Wrapped

Description: I've found the different ways that people interact and experience museums to be special and truly unique. Instead of developing an interactive component for exhibits themselves, I wanted to develop a method that would incentivize visitors to engage with the pieces they encounter in the museum. For my project, I want to make a platform that allows visitors to view a compilation of data about their activity and reactions throughout their visit. I am hoping to compile this data by placing individual QR codes at pieces in the exhibition (or some other method), which visitors can mark when they are left with an impression. In addition to the fact that these pieces can be saved for the visitor for the extent of their visit, the platform will analyze the visitors' trends/tendencies in a clean collage design that they can export as an image, as a snapshot of their visit (i.e. "Who's your biggest artist?", "Other artists you might enjoy", "Based off your art period preferences, you would be born in the year...", etc.)

Envisioned Audience: All visitors, most likely individuals that like to save art pieces as they seem them and that use their phones alreayd as a tool during their museum visit.
