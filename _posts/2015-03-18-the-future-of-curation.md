This document was interesting for a couple of reasons. First, it was strange to me because it wasn't a manifesto or a set of suggestions for updating libraries. It was a collection of ideas about how libraries need to change, some relevant discussion and examples, and a set of questions for the library workers to discuss amongst themselves. 
	
I don't think it's unreasonable to leave out a distinct set of rules, because the problem of updating libraries is not a one size fits all solution. It requires careful consideration of the library or museum in question and what purpose it wants (or can) serve in its community. However, I did find the layout a bit odd. It raises questions that it barely tries to answer, and as a consolation prize offers glimpses of libraries and museums that have successfully navigated these questions. For an administrator who is unsure of the future of his/her library, I could see this being an intimidating document full of hard questions and successful examples that could feel irrelevant. For someone willing to dive into those questions, it seems reasonable, but these are hard questions offered with little direction.

However, I was interested in the potential for updating libraries to better serve their purpose in the information age. It is possible to look at a library as an outdated version of modern search engines, disregarding the value in having both a physical collection and one that may have less well-known resources available. But libraries can offer not only access to these online resources for those unable to access them, but also a community space to encourage learning and excitement about those resources that are available.

It is possible to see a library as a way to encourage people to meet with each other and discuss media they have both seen. By leveraging the knowledge of what a person has read, watched, or searched for, we can help them find others in their community who may share their interests, or even suggest other titles they might enjoy. Obviously this is me using my computer science interests, but I think encouraging digital tools to allow interpersonal relations to grow is an important application. What worth is a community center if it doesn't bring people together?
