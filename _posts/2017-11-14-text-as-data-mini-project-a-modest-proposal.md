title: 'Text As Data Mini-Project: A Modest Proposal'

I tried out the TopicGraph for the mini project and decided to analyze A Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift because I was interested in how the tool would work with a piece of satire, especially given its goals of enabling you to quickly understand the topics covering in texts

The tool is straightforward, allowing users to either choose from a selection of documents or upload a pdf version of their own. After uploading, it pretty quickly sends an email notifying you that the document is ready. You’re linked to an easy to read and well-structured website which lists phrases that occurred most frequently. It also allows you to go to individual pages, which I found particularly useful.

Some of the words/word strings it picked up were “Irish Nationalism” “Meats” “Christian History” and “Body Fat” which are definitely relevant but on their own don’t contribute much to understanding the text itself.

Ultimately, this tool isn’t one that can be used for a deep and involved analysis of a text, since it misses important contextual clues and priorities word count instead. That being said, it is a nice way to get a vague idea of what is going on in the text, and how the author is trying to get their point across.
