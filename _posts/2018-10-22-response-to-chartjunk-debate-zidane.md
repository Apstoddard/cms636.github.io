title: Response to Chartjunk Debate - Zidane

## ##
It's clear that Tufte's view of graphical representations of data is not an amicable one. He views the majority (probably all) of commonly used graphical displays as distractions that add nothing to a data set, and can easily ruin its potential for intrigue and educational value. When I read his views I thought he was on to something for extreme cases where graphs become unreadable and cluttered, but he was being a little harsh in including ALL graphics in this statement. The author of the article has similar sentiments. He also thinks even if data displays are redundant in some ways, this does not make them inherently worthless, something I agree with.

	Tufte says the 'thigh-graph' is uncontextual because Hughes conflates two separate trends, and then right after he assumes people shouldnt trust a graph simply because of the format it's presented in! I highly disagree with this statement. In the next paragraph, he assumes that the attempt to make data more engagable through graphics shows contempt for the audience, assuming they are foolish and uncaring. Again, where is the correlation? I feel like if anything, making work more presentable is a service to the reader.
    
    The conclusion of the study referred to in this article was in support of the side of graphical embellishments. And I think to a certain degree, this is right. As the author says," It isnâ€™t surprising that we can usually recall an image that expresses a clever and entertaining visual metaphor better than we can recall an unembellished chart."
    
    However, it was made clear that the study wasn't conducted in a setting that would make the results reliable enough to be taken seriously. The author said that these graphs would only be useful in a small subset of cases. Tufte would say that all graphical displays should be eliminated. However, if there are any cases where these graphs would enhance learning, why remove them? 
    
    
	With regards to this debate, I am more on the side of the author. The assumption/statement that numbers alone are boring is one that I have encountered many times in differnet disciplines. I feel like it's intuitive that no one would particularly enjoy looking at endless rows of colummns and tables - appropriate usage of design principles should be applied. A big argument the author made is that the experiment was not conducted properly, so the results can only be used as a suggestion and not conclusive. I agree wiht this, and while I support the proper use of embellishments, I do not support the citing of this particular study as a measure of absolute certainty in support of either side.
