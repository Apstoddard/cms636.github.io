To be honesty, I'm not a fan of sounds. This sounds (oh good pun!) weird, but I'm really sensitive to sounds. I absolutely HATE whistling, so much so that everyone on my floor knows not to whistle when I'm around. It just bothers me so much.

I'm honestly a visual and auditory learner. I can't just sit in class and simply learn by listening, nor can I really sit down and learn by reading a text book. I either need to be sitting there taking notes in class, or writing notes on the side of the margins to really absorb knowledge. In my opinion listening to learn is not effective because I dont absorb everything that is said. The worst part about it all is if it is not recorded, the sound is effemeral, not lasting. What was just said can never be repeated the same way again. This really takes aaway from the understanding portion of sound because if youre trying to understand what was just said and then you ask to have it repeated, the person who just said it wont be able to say it the same again and it'll be different. A recording is good because you can keep going back into the recording and replaying a part, but at some point, this is just monotonous and doesn't keep your attention the whole time.
