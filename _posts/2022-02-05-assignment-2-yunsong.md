**What is a Museum**
What is a Museum delineates the shifting agency of museums from the patrician institution of elite culture to the populist center of leisure and entertainment, in terms of audience, public engagement. Alexander asked about the role of the 21st-century museum, I felt that this could be discussed together with last week’s topic of the participatory museum, the public engagement, and hybridity of programs.
**Before Museums**
The selected Cabinets in which “poetic connections between seemingly incongruous objects” were made seem to demonstrate more clearly the subjectivity of the collection than museums.

**Wetbsite Review: British Museum**
General website: https://www.britishmuseum.org/
- Like any other website: general information and events 
- Offer learning programs for communities; students; young people; adult; The Samsung Digital Discovery Centre (SDDC) offers free digital activities for schools and families. (all physical)
- Guided tours: around the world; Cultural Theme;(more curated)

Apart from the general website, they did one interface with google:
https://britishmuseum.withgoogle.com/
- A lot of effort building up the website, game interface
- Intuitive navigation, using mouse

- Archival method of presenting
- Not simulating a physical tour 
- Organized based on thematic relevance, chronological sequence, constellations of items.
- The index is shown as peddles (dots), click the dots to see details, contrary to physical tour that we see the exhibits before everything else

- Seems to serve research audience, 
- Not a substitute for an actual visit
