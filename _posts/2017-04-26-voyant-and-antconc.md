Text: “Pride and Prejudice”

**Fun facts research: where the prefix go?**
When I load the full text of "Pride and Prejudice", the interface of Voyant seems like this.

It draws my attention that the frequency of the word "mr" and "mrs" drops down rapidly when it comes to end of the book. However, the use of lead's name "Elizabeth" and "Darcy" is not rising that much. Then I add more names into the charts. It seems like teh prefix is taken place by names when readers "get to know" charaters.

I tried the similar research on the Antconc. It does not seem like that nice and easy to do the same thing. I have to search each word seperatly if I would like to compare them, however, it is easier in Antconc to combine the word together. Sometimes it is not clear when lines mix with each other.

Voyant obviously has better user interface and friendly user experience. It predicts the needs of user and reflect them in the interaction details.
