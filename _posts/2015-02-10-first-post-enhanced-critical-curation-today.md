When we move into a digital space, established practices in humanities can disappear, be changed, or be reinforced. The digital space is an incubator for wonderful ways of thinking. There are innovative epistemic and cognitive interactions with collections of knowledge.  

I found the first reading on Enhanced Critical Curation very interesting. Modes of representation and storage can be essential or unessential to the text it actually holds. Information can be presented in ways that purposefully change perception or ways that create arbitrary convention. One of my favorite designers is Bret Victor and this piece reminded me of his concept “The Inhumane Representation of Thought.” He feels that there is no need for the plethora of texts and academia hidden in flatness, stagnancy, lack of interactivity, and one person perspective. The “Scale” text also talked about how the many texts de-emphasizing the cult of the individual. This aspect is very salient in today’s collection building and curation. There are huge quantities of data and a lot of digital space to build. Places like Pinterest or the blogosphere are divided into simply reposting or adding value with curation as craft.
