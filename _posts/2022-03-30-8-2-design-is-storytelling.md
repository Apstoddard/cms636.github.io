I like how Lupton drives home the point that effective design is like storytelling. For both design and storytelling, it's not about the cold hard facts. You have to include the person and emotion behind it. She includes great examples of this like how a photo book tells a personal history and is not just a container for pictures.

Her section on storyboarding felt applicable to the UI/UX my group will be doing for the EC history project. My group will need to clarify our design language. Wireframes and inspiration will be a objective way for us to ensure we stick to our main goals and design.
