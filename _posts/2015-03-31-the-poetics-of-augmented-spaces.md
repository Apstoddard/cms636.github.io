My experience in Cambridge public libraries made me ponder Manovich’s question of whether “cultural institutions play an active, leading role where alternate futures [of technology] are tested.” While Cambridge Public library was the first in the world to offer free, fast Internet to the public, its innovation stops there. It does augment its space with large displays of calendars and current transit conditions, but does not offer any new and novel interactions. I would love to see libraries offer new ways to discover books and other library resources. Great book displays are often effective, but I could only imagine how great a mobile tour of a library could be (perhaps offering previews of topics or popular books in the area). 

I also wanted to voice my partial disappointment in the Manovich article. Manovich never fully explained why we would want data dense experiences.  While he listed off the rich fields that relate to digital humanities (ubiquitous computing. AR, TUIs, and more), he failed to explore them. As a huge fan of AR and tangible user interfaces, I would have loved to hear more about the importance of embodiment and physicality in pedagogy and the human understanding and absorption of information.
