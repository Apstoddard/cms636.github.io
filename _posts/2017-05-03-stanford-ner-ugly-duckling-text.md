So I used the tool on a piece of the "Ugly Duckling" story for both English and Spanish. It seemed to do quite a good job at point out things like dependicies, parts of speech, and entities. I actually found it interesting when comparing the same text from two different languages because then it helped me realize how different the languages are from each other especially in their grammar and sentence structures. 

This image shows the parts of speech for the English language version of the text.
