So I used the tool on a piece of the "Ugly Duckling" story for both English and Spanish. It seemed to do quite a good job at point out things like dependencies, parts of speech, and entities. I actually found it interesting when comparing the same text from two different languages because then it helped me realize how different the languages are from each other especially in their grammar and sentence structures. 

I am still a bit confused as to why we are doing this or why we would need this. However, like I said before I feel it would be interesting especially when using it with another language. It really gives a broader idea of how that things are structured and connected in that language which then maybe could be useful as insight into the text. 

This image shows the parts of speech and dependencies for the English language version of the text.
