_Commentary by Ben Reynolds_

As a Computer Scientist, I was happy to see the Law of Large Numbers referenced in this section of the textbook. Due to the Law of Large Numbers, computational methods allow us to confidently answer a different set of questions than the humanities typically allows. There is a danger in trying to infer too much from a single data point. You can read a single work of literature extremely closely and learn a lot in the process, but if you try to extrapolate the themes of a single work to draw generalized cultural conclusions about a place or era, there’s no guarantee that the single work wasn’t an anomaly. That’s where the Law of Large Numbers helps out. As you look at more and more works of literature, the chance increases that they accurately represent the average, which means we can find trends, patterns, and draw conclusions about cultural phenomena. And with over 21 billion indexed pages on the web, we have a plethora of data points to analyze with statistical significance. Analyzing a corpus of works at such a distance isn’t the only valuable way to approach the humanities; indeed, when you look at the average, you miss out on the individual texture that makes each work so interesting. However, being able to recognize trends and patterns with confidence is a valuable tool for drawing a set of conclusions that augments those of a close reading.
