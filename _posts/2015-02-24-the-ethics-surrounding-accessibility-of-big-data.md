title: The Ethics Surrounding Accessibility of Big Data

Several of the "Provocations Surrounding Big Data" highlighted the misconception that big data was immune to all ethical dilemmas surrounding other data used in sociological research. The newness of the digital age has left scholars in uncertain territory, leading to practices, which could cross the ethical line. I was most intrigued by those involving accessibility.

First, in "Just Because it is Accessible Doesn’t Make it Ethical," Boyd and Crawford discuss the ethical implications of pulling data from users on social media sites. They argue that much of this data is set in a very specific context and is not meant for an audience as a whole. This provocation is interesting as both sides to the debate: ethical and non, are well documented. As mentioned in the article, all studies concerning human subjects require "informed consent" and privacy of subjects. Yet, as many of the so-called "millennial generation" have heard, "what you put on the web is public and can be found" (or some variation). The idea that web content is private was throughly debunked in educating kids about the dangers of the net. Thus, there is a tension between these two ideas.

The public availability of this data leads to the second point that "Limited Access to Big Data Creates New Digital Divides." While all of this data is ostensibly public, it is not necessarily accessible. Just because something can be found, does not mean it takes no skill to find and isolate/contextualize the relevant pieces of information. Yet this idea is not exclusive to big data. Prioritized access is prevalent in many written forms of media as well. Until the Comédie Française project becomes public that data is unavailable to many scholars. Additionally, just because data is available does not mean that everyone has the knowledge and ability to use it. The public availability of big data does not account for the traditional barriers of accessibility, which exist in these studies.
