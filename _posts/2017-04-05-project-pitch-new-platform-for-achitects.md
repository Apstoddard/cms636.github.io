### Problem

Famous architects design buildings that are treasures to humans. But only a few of us can have a chance to fully get to know them. What is more, even the most famous noted architect just use text and images (even video is rare) to show their works online. The value and knowledge behind one famous architect like I. M. Pei is enormous. What if we could figure a way to better integrate architects career and works to offer a new perspective for the world to better understand the power of architecture?

### Approach

This project tries to design an interactive online system that can clearly exhibit architect’s work or research and provide a platform where reader could freely choose different data categories to make comparative study. There will be 2 dimensions of the project: time and location. The previous studies including US-Iran Project and Melville Project, they all dealt with 4 elements: time, location, text and image. But for an architect’s career mapping, it is more challenging because 2 reasons: the first will be the difficulty of representing 3D projects in a way that is other than 2D pictures. The other one is within every project, there would be also a timeline showing how and when architect got involved in the design. 

### Audience

The potential audience includes researchers, students, artists, visitors and so on.
This project would be a great tool for researchers who is interested in the architect, or specific projects or studies done by the architect. It is also welcome to whoever needs detail info. and encouraging everyone to participate in editing contents and leaving comments. 

### Skills Needed

1.Design: Design methods to represent 3D experience and 2 kind of timeline in one project?
2.Implementation: Front-end and back-end web development skill.
