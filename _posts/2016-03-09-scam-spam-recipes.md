title: Scam/Spam Recipes
---

Before coming to MIT, I spent a year earning a degree in French Patisserie in Paris, during which I gained an immense appreciation for the art of recipe creation. Examining the scam/spam messages in the Google Sheet, I noticed that there are a handful of rhetorical components that are often mixed and matched to create many variants of scam messages--much like different ingredients and techniques are mixed and matched to create an endless variety of culinary dishes. Some example components (or ingredients) are: medical-related stories, finance-related stories, personal details, antivirus promises, flattering remarks, etc. These components are roughly analogous to the key ingredients of a dish: a protein, starch, vegetables, seasoning, sauce, etc. On the other hand, we have common techniques: evoking guilt, instilling fear, stimulating greed, confusing the reader, etc. These techniques are analogous to the procedures you learn about in culinary school: folding, beating, laminating dough, roasting, searing, etc.  
The analogy between scam messages and recipes made me think about creating some sort of scam recipe visualization. This would allow you to see the composition of these scam messages--drawing to attention the similarities and differences between different strategies. The exact details of the visualization need to be fleshed out still, but it would be reminiscent of cook books, online recipes, and cooking channel type visuals--all in the context of these scam messages.
