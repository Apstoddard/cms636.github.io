### How are museums using artificial intelligence, and is AI the future of museums

Currently, most exhibitions are designed from the curator's perspective. However, with the help of ML, curators can analyze data about visitors' behavior, eyes, and tours to help curators understand or predict participants' preferences and maintain visitor engagement. For example, some exhibitions use ML to collect how long people stay at the exhibition, respond to people's behavior, and use this information to develop and implement adaptive exhibitions.

But at the same time, it is also clear that "the world is still in the phase of 'training the toddler' when it comes to AI, helping it deal with real life situations as they emerge", so human intervention is needed in the process of ML computing, especially for culturally relevant exhibitions, to help build more inclusive, broad-based, and equitable exhibitions.

### The Shape of Art History in the Eyes of the Machine

Machine learning can yield new insights into relationships in the visual arts because machines can capture details, patterns and hidden connections in paintings that are difficult for the human eye to detect and find unexpected similarities in subject matter, pattern and visual style.
