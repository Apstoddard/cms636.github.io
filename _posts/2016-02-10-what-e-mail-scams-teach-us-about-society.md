title: "What E-mail Scams Teach us About Society"
---

The assigned articles present e-mail scams as something more than just criminal activities and show that these scams can reveal much about the society we have created. The book The Rumors of the World explains that e-mail scams appeal to the victim’s desire to get rich quick. While it is probably normal to seek reward through the least effort possible, it is possible that this is symptomatic of the age of the Internet we now live in. People in electronic societies are able to achieve reward faster than ever before, accessing information and entertainment almost immediately on the internet, and the billions of dollars that victims lose to e-mail scams may be evidence that society is becoming more ‘spoiled’ in this sense.

The articles also associate e-mail scams with characteristics of our economic and political landscape. The article Dearest One, My Sincere Greetings To You, And How Are You Doing? seems to place great emphasis on the idea that e-mail scammers are no different than the corrupt bankers and businessmen that swindle the common folk and led to the recession of 2008. I personally do not know enough about the true level of corruption in the world’s dominant financial institutions, and I was left with the impression that the author didn’t either, since he didn’t spend much time explaning exactly why those institutions are corrupt. However, I was convinced by his claim that the corruption of third-world countries like Nigeria creates a desperate and dishonest atmosphere that easily breeds the criminals who distribute scam e-mails.

I also enjoyed reading about the film that Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige have created. It seems to be an effective way of making the viewer understand the way in which scammers emotionally connect with their victims through their message.
