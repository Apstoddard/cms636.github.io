My Wunderkammer is about dissection of life and examining it through different lenses. 
To peel back and dissect through the layers of life, one must be intentional and also adventurous. One must examine life closely and from afar. I present to you a collection that represents several layers of the dissection of life through the five senses and their philosophy. It is intended to examine the mundane things we encounter every day through different lenses.
