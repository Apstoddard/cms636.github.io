## Digital Journalism 


The rise of interactive digital journalism has powerful implications for news disseminationâ€“  in an effort to tackle a post-truth society, we hope to develop an idea focusing on the accurate representation, delivery, and accessibility of data in media. Through a project that will focus on the reporting of legalization/decriminalization of marijuana and its ties to the prison-industrial complex, we hope to analyze quantitative prison data provided by the government, via https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=daa. Moreover, it will tie in qualitative information to create a holistic approach to representing the issue that takes a position, critically explains the data, and removes ambiguity between truth and alternative fact for the public. This project will re-evaluate the role of data scientists, journalists, and designers in informing the public and making information once-again accessible for everyone.
