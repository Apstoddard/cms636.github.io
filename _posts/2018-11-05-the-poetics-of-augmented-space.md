Manovich calls for us to go "beyond the ‘surface as electronic screen paradigm’" and think of information flow as something physical, tangible, and studied just as much as the material.

I think Manovich is correct in that often, people who work with media often think of the virtual space as something separated from the physical space by a screen, or by technology. Rarely do we think of the physical and virtual space as one, an entirely new expanse Manovich calls "augmented space".

The MIT Museum struggled to make that jump of seamlessly blending the physical and the virtual. The "black box" Manovich described was certainly on display, with a video playing on the first floor with seats facing the projector -- a standard, uniform way for visitors to experience the virtual, with a clear divide between what was electronic and what was physical.

There were a few exhibits that managed to somewhat cross the divide. The stairs that lit up and played tones when a person walked across them involved both physical and virtual elements. But the physical seemed more like triggers for the virtual rather than a blending of the two.

I think blending best occurs when the virtual actively engages and makes use of the user's physical space, rather than expecting the user to shift from the physical into the virtual. In the example Manovich gave, Janet Cardiff's Alter Bahnhof Video Walk ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkQE7m31Pw]()), visual and auditory information from both the phone (the virtual space) and the grounds of the Kulturbahnhof in Kassel (the physical space) are blended in such a way it is difficult to differentiate one exprience from the other. They are blended such that they become one experience.

Cardiff's piece reminds me of Yoko Ono's work, like her poems in _Grapefruit_, which are written as instructions. By commanding the reader to physically do something, Ono blurs the line between the imagination and the physical world, much like Cardiff blurs the line between virtual and physical.

In _Cut Piece_ ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yqhSZsXIJQ]()), Ono breaks down the "black box" Manovich describes of performer and audience by asking the audience to cut off a piece of her clothing and take it with them. It introduces themes of vulnerability of the artist and effectively combines the space of "performance" and "audience" until they are indistinguishable.

So, Manovich's idea of blending worlds is not a new one. But the idea of specifically blending the virtual and the physical in an augmented space, and treating the blending as a "substance" as tangible as the physical, is a novel idea, atleast for me. Drucker called for us to focus on the experiential over the material. Manovich seems to say that the two are so tightly intertwined that that we can should treat augmented space, and the flow of electronic data within, the same way we do with the material.
