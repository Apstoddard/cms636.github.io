## Case Study 3- Augmented Objects & Spaces: Jewish Ritual Objects in Diaspora:
This case study takes in to account the provenance of the objects in the museum, which I find to be especially important. You cannot truly understand something or someone if you don’t understand the origin of it. In this sense, provenance is crucial to preserving the artifact’s cultural and historical implications. I also appreciated that the museum sought to bring in the people whose culture is being displayed so that they can understand how to best or showcase (or not) certain artifacts that were obtained “surreptitiously”. 

## Case Study 4- Virtual Reconstruction of an Afghan Refugee Camp as a Site for cultural memory:
While this virtual reconstruction of an Afghan refugee camp is unique, its focus on reinventing traumatic experiences for users brings up many questions for me. While I realize that the purpose of this virtual reality immersive experience isn’t solely to reinvent traumatic experiences of those who endured these camps, I could not help but keep that at the forefront of my thoughts when reading this case study. 

## Case Study 5- Multi-Authored Locative Investigation of the Zenon Headquarters and Corporate Archive 
I believe that if done right, this project can be scalable and translated across a multitude of historic buildings with rich history embedded in the architectural landscape. The most fascinating part of this project to me was having to take something physical (augmented reality) and turn it into an experience that off-site visitors could also enjoy. This addresses the notion of accessibility within the field of Digital Humanities in a way that I sometimes feel is overlooked. I appreciated the call to action to allow those interested but unable to visit the site, the opportunity to explore the archive in a unique way.
