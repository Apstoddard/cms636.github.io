We’ve reached out to Debbie about our interest in working with the Tangible Media Group. She’s corresponded with Hiroshi’s lab manager as well as the director of galleries and exhibitions at the MIT Museum and has received positive responses from both of them about our project on this exhibition. We’ll be following up with her to discuss also our ideas and vision for the inFORM.

We have also connected with Daniel Pillis from the MIT Media Lab Tangible Media group. He works for Hiroshi Ishii, and has allowed us to explore the inFORM and transFORM. The group has been made aware of our intent to create an exhibit for inFORM, and they are looking forward to working with us. 

We were also able to observe users interact with the inFORM during the MIT Media Lab spring meeting. Hiroshi was running demos, and I was able to watch people play with the machine. It attracted quite a bit of attention, and people like the physical aspect of the machine. People were especially interested in moving the ball, and I also observed two people “pass” the ball back and forth by using the machine together. I also observed young kids using the machine, and they were equally fascinated by it and had no trouble learning how to use it.
