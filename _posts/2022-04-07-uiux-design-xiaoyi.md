### visual interface design

- The author raises an important point of user experience in the paper that I found valuable. I would stress that users' engagement in the ADDIE process is crucial, not only for interface design, but also for the whole product design.

- Aesthetic function and pratical function
Though this two terms may target on different layers, they are both part of user experience and interface design and have some overlaps, since, to my point of view, aesthetic function also provide users with association between notions of quality and attention to detail.
So, a combination of aesthetic function and easy-to-navigate/practical function would also greatly improves user experience and performance.
