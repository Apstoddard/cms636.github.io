1. Are there good records of scam messages over time and if so where do these records come from? It seem like since scam messages are viewed as undesirable or even dangerous and are often automatically deleted it would be difficult to curate them.
2. What trends are there in terms of changes in the types of people that are targeted by scam messages over time? How have those changes been reflected in the narratives of scam messages? Are those changes more reflective of a greater number of people becoming reachable by scam messages or are they more reflective of certain groups of people becoming more or less susceptible to scams messages over time?
3. How do different genres of scam emails emerge? Are there a large number of unique scam message narratives that are unique to particular scammers or are there only a few unique scam message narratives that have been slightly modified and copied by a large number of scammers?
