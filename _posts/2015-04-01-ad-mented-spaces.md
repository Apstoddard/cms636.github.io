Interestingly, it seems that the ad industry is leading the charge on developing new augmented spaces. This makes sense, as there are literally billions of advertisement dollars spent every year. Also, it is an intensely competitive market, with every player trying to come up with the next big thing that will give them an edge for a while. However, these are not really the people that I would **like** to be pushing this research forward, as they are doing so basically because they believe it will extract more money from my pocket. A great example of this is Rem Koolhaasâ€™ Prada store in New York, as discussed in the article. The store implemented some cool new examples of what augmented spaces can be, but it was only because it meant I might be more likely to come in and spend money.

The flip side of this was made somewhat apparent by my trip to the Museum of Science recently. While there were a few attempts to incorporate some of the paradigms discussed in the "Poetics of Augmented Space," none of them were particularly captivating, cool, or impressive. Everything had a feeling of lack of budget and lack of modernism. Once again, this is understandable as museums have limited budgets, and creating an amazing virtual space is both expensive, and in some sense not expected of them.

I think the most interesting pushes for this field occur not in the ad space, but academia. The MIT Media Lab has many projects which fall into the augmented space field, and there are many other schools participating. I recently stumbled across an amazing display of what can be done with projection and technology today: http://nofilmschool.com/2013/09/projection-mapping-bot-and-dollys-incredible-short-film-box

Just because ad agencies are leading the charge, however, doesn't mean that the advancement is not being made. The ad money pouring into this field, and the more altruistic academic research, will eventually down to the more 'every day' use cases. This may just be another example were 'undesirable' means of advancement (through advertising money) could be justified by the useful ends they result in.
