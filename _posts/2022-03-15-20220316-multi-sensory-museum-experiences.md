## _Multi-Sensory Museum Experiences: Balancing Objects’ Preservation And Visitors’ Learning_, A. Baccaglini

### Museums’ Use of Collections and Visitors’ Learning Experiences
  I do agree that with the rise of technology, visual stimulation has become the most predominantly saturated sense. However, a mass movement of experiences into the saturation of any other senses as discussed in the introduction could be detrimental to long-term human memory and satisfaction. As I have discussed previously, smell & taste are the two most important senses for longer-lasting memories (40+ years, 20220215_The_Experience_Economy) while sight has a functional memory timeline of 10-15 years. I do however agree that museums have failed to truly engage or stimulate the general public with a one-sided interpretation of displayed narratives; it is imperitive to shift this to allow for discussion, which I believe is the most effective stimulating & engaging technique that is driven by an inherently social aspect of information exchange. Tactile- and discussitory- based exhibits can be a great start to balance addressing several learning types and increasing general engagement with information.
  
### Case Studies, _Rijksmuseum van Oudheden_
  I like the idea of being able to handle historical objects in a controlled environment; often, ancient people are alienated and made to be "other" - evidenced by surprise of peers and scholars when discovering the fairly "modern" leisure activities of populations in stable periods - to where contemporary people cannot make connections to this ancient life:
  > The personal, emotional and intellectual distances between visitors and objects on display are 
lessened through physical interaction
  
  Something to consider while planning for this tactile exhibit piece, however, is whether these objects can withstand constant manipulation and how to most safely allow public access for both the object's sake and the visitor's sake.
