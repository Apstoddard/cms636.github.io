## Assignment 3 part 3: Project Idea

### Idea:
An interactive interactive visualization of the emotions of people around campus.

### Delivery Platform
It would probably be a web-app so it could be accessed from any laptop or mobile phone, but it would ideally also exist on physical touch-screens - maybe one on the infinite, and/or one in the MIT Mental Health and Counselling hallway.

Passers by would be able to input how they feel in less than a minute with a simple intuitive interface (maybe using sliders between opposite emotions such as tired<---->energetic, or with emotions inside bubbles which can be expanded based on the strength of the feeling) and even tag reasons for their emotions (e.g. problem sets, exams, friends, projects, music) then get to see how their mood fits into a visualization of all the other mood data from that day. 

### Features:
Display mood data on different time scales (past day, past week, past month etc), display mood by location - overlaid on a map of campus (this would work well if many people access the web app without using the mural), use clustering algorithms to categorize moods

### Basic question (what are you trying to solve)
Feeling connected across the MIT community, tracking mood over time, mindful reflection. 
### Audience
MIT community
### Data
Collected from the audience.
