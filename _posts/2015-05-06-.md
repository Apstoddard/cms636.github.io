The article points out that media has changed immensely in the past few decades. The shift from traditional literacy to new media literacy is both an exciting change and a challenge for educators. I agree with the article that it is important for educators to think about how to incorporate new media into the curriculum. Also, I believe that we should not be afraid of accepting new media although it might seem like it's slowly taking over the old media's place. For example, when Kindle first came out, a lot of people were worried that it's going to ruin the physical books and reading experience. Convenience of Kindle definitely makes it easier for people on the go to read whenever they want and carry as many books as possible at once. However, there are people who prefer the texture and feel of physical books. Kindle and other ebooks also allow users to annotate their book without having to worry about ruining the book and to see other people's annotation. These advantages make it more available for participation.
