  Public Space and Public Life in Marais (From the 17th to the
  20th)-Miles-Pojiang-Chaoran
---
Marais is historically been a Jewish neighborhood in Paris and recently itâ€™s become more of a gay neighborhood and a hip area for shopping, design, arts. Through looking at the public open space, such as the plazas and courts, and the historical sites, we would like to have a better understand of how the public space and the public life transit through the time in Marais from the 17th to the 20th.

1 We create the collections in a chronological way and put the photos which reflect the the history, major event, function, form and activities in that period in each one.we are not only presenting the form of public space but also what people did inside it. These collections can give visitors the knowledge of how the urban space and the related urban activities transformed over time.

2 We create the "tag function" to categorize these photos by different topics,such as birdview, pedestrian perspective, daily life, which reflected from the items . So visitors can search the items by the perspective they are curious about.
