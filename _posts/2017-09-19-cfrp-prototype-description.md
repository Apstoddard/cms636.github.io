1. Your approach to go from facsimile to data
First of all, we should translate the language for later use. Then we should find the similar and different information on these records for comparison, and try to analyze and simplify them to find the key elements. Later, we can think about the methods to represent the readable date. 

2. Identify the different categories of information on these page
There are three main categories in these four pages: a. Receipt with different seats categories, prices, tickets number and total revenue b. Expense records with different purposes. c. dates and locations. Potentially, there could be theater and casting information on other pages.

3. Develop a method for the extraction of this information and conversion into digital format
Since the language used in the facsimiles is mostly old French, it’s difficult for the general public to understand. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of the extraction work, we should invite researchers and students who study related subjects from different universities or institutes around the world to contribute to the work. In return, they will have easy access to the data for their research. Also, coding experts are especially important in finishing this digital format products. 

4. The process by which you will store and present the data
Once we have all of the facsimile data digitized into a static database, we can run queries to retrieve the information to display to the user. The data will be presented to the user in the form of a line graph. The user will specify what parts of the data (e.g. number of tickets sold or price of the most average ticket) they would like to display and the interface will show them how that data changed over time. The interface will also allow the user to display historic data from other sources to compare to the facsimile data. Users can also select a specific year and view all of the data gathered from the facsimile for that year.

5. What tools you will be building?
We will be using a web interface with a database backend (e.g. mySQL), which will provide the information to the UI. The user can specify the information that they want displayed on the line graph, and the web page responds by running a script on the backend to query the necessary data from the database. This data is then displayed to the user. The display is dynamically updated (using javascript) based on the user’s requests.

6. Who is the exact audience for your approach?
Our approach is meant for academics who are researching the daily life of Parisians in the late 17th-18th centuries, up until the eve of the French Revolution. These people would normally be historians, but students may also be included. To target this group, we would give academic institutions access to our site. 
Data can be uploaded and downloaded easily with this open platform.
The webpage is also accessible to the public. We present the data in simple line chart without burdening the audience with too much information; however, the option to explore more is always there for those who are interested.  

7. What kind of questions does your project address?
The project allows the audience to cross reference multiple types of data and identify trends over time. With this, they can answer a number of different research questions.  For example, they can determine the amount spent on different leisure activities and compare that to the economic situation to learn more about average lifestyles. They can also track how well run the theater was over time by looking at profits. Given the enormity of the events happening at the time, this information could shed light on broader societal issues within Paris.
