##Project Title: 
(Never) Lost in Museums

##Problem Statement: 
As someone who is very directionally challenged, whenever I'm in a big museum or even a medium sized museum (MFA in Boston), I have a lot of difficulties knowing where I am. Sometimes I find myself going back to the same section of the museum all the time unable to find the sections I actually want to go to. I think it would very helpful to have a mobile app that maps out different recommended route of the museum. In addition, if the party is separated during the visit, it is often awkward to call each other in a quiet museum. If there is a way to connect friends' phones, it would be much easier to find each other in a museum. 

##Approach: 
I envision this being a mobile app with the layout of the museum pre-loaded and can track the location of the visitors by use GPS. Users can also tag their location on a map by scanning a QR-code, bar-code or taking a picture of the nearby exhibit. If the users tag a certain exhibit, they will also be given additional information about the exhibit.
