Adrian Freed and Lisa Wymore are working together with a small team of creative engineers and artists to make a [digital platform](http://zlabucb.blogspot.com) that has a low threshold of entry. The system would allow people interested in embodied actions, gesture, sensation, bodily expression, etc. to enter the space and build digital instruments that are activated by a variety of sensor and camera based inputs. These instruments will then be sharable so that those entering the spaces where the platform is activated will be able to build and create artistic experiences in relationship to past explorations within the system. The platform will also allow teachers interested in working with sensors and 3D cameras to engage quickly and reliably with the technology in the space. Our hope is that other laboratories like the Z-Lab will create spaces utilizing this platform so that we can collaborate and create networks.
