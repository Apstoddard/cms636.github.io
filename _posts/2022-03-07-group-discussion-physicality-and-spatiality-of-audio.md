title: Group Discussion -- Physicality and Spatiality of Audio
author: 'Emma Batson, Marina Monsivais, Tiffany Tran'
---
Key features of project so far:
- make typically untouchable collections immersive in ways they usually aren't
- add a physical aspect to these items
- add a spatiotemporal aspect to these items
- probably targeting audio collections
- really kind of using a high-tech approach to give a more low-tech, accessible feel to the collections -- the tech should make itself invisible

Potential directions:
- make a physical copy of the object (or of objects discussed/hinted at in audio)
- create a soundscape by having multiple audio player stations, which are controlled or influenced by the visitor in some way
- have physical objects that are "linked" to an audio file and can trigger playback at certain stations (maybe plays different audio depending on the station?)
- audio continually running at different stations, and visitors have their own "cassette tape" they can tap to "record" a clip they heard an interesting snippet from, to be sent to them in full later

Questions/challenges:
- how do you choose what objects to replicate, especially from an audio file?
- how do you deal with having potentially a lot of interactive objects that can become disorganized/scattered all over the floor? is there a way to embrace the inevitable messiness?
- how do we link interactive objects to points in space in a way that is intuitive for the visitor?
- how do we encourage exploration of the space in a way that provides a satisfying experience for any one of many nonlinear or incomplete paths?
- what kinds of stories depend on both physicality and spatiality? how can we design this project to best highlight these?
