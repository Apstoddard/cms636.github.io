Manovich's approach to GUI (Graphical User interface) is interesting in the way he describes it as a circular pattern where there is a migration into the digital realm for the last period of time while recently there have been a bridging back into the physical reality manifested through AR/VR and all the Human-Computer interaction platforms. 

He stresses out the importance of the use of computers as a medium used both to execut work tasks and leisure/gaming activities.
