Manovich's approach to GUI (Graphical User interface) is interesting in the way he describes it as a circular pattern where there is a migration into the digital realm for the last period of time while recently there have been a bridging back into the physical reality manifested through AR/VR and all the Human-Computer interaction platforms. 

He stresses out the importance of the use of computers as a medium used both to execute work tasks and leisure/gaming activities.
The parallelism he draws between description and narration and then again between narratives and databases is insighttful. Actually nowadays a lot of importance is put to the aesthetics and the representation medium(description)which might at some point overwhelm the information conveyed(narrative). This mainly manifested through the communication medium used in web interfaces .

Databases being in their nature a collection of data follow a specific logic from gathering to storing and indexing. While the web is an open platform that keeps on growing, Manovich points out how this feature puts webpages under the collection title rather than a narrative.

While the simple assignement of a task for the player within a game(winning, killing the monster, achieving a high score...) pushes the interaction into the narrative realm.
Games are by nature governed by algorithms where as Wright explains the repetition of the experience turns into a loop building between the human mental model and the computer model.
