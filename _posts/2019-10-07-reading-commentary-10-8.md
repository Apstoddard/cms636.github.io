I enjoyed reading the history of the timeline as presented by Rosenberg and Grafton. As they implied, I didn’t really think much about the story of cartography, so it was good to get that background, although it honestly wasn't as shocking as they implied it would be. It was interesting to consider the extent to which technological innovation has influenced cartography and influence our perception of history and time in doing so.I liked the idea of an accessible but informative chronology- on 117, they write “Priestley designed his charts for the curiosity and pleasure of a general reader, but they were also meant to serve the scholar—and Priestley believed that the two aims were well served by the same approach.” It feels that sometimes graphics are produced with only one of these aims in mind, so I appreciate the goal of keeping both in mind from the very beginning. I’m not sure it’s always doable, and depends on the data that is being used, but it’s a nice idea. 
 I also was sort of disappointed in a similar way that I was with the Drucker reading- I was looking forward to seeing new possibilities for displaying information and didn’t really see those. That said, I imagine that’s mostly due to the fact that we read historical chapters! I’d like to see more of what’s being done now.
