We are now at a stage in the project process where the most of the digital prototype has been developed. In the past week I modified the lyric generation code and created the on-demand lyric generation that can be done by clicking into a specfic song and clicking the "generate" link. This was a bit involved as it involved understanding the original NLP project enough to recode it and generate new songs by the original song's genre. I also looked into playing with increasing the prior probability analysis to include more of the original song, hopefully increasing the readability and retaining the orginal artist's style. Users of the site can then edit the chords and lyrics of the song by clicking on them and typing. I also spruced up the home navigation and figured out how to upload the site to Heroku (a web hosting site). Ran into a few snags for a bit, but figured it out!! Next main steps are to expand the visualization page and to allow users to upload their creations to the the database. After this, there are a ton of tiny updates I would like to explore, as well as an expansion of the original song database.

The Visualization part aims to guide the music absolute beginners to study the fundamental theories of the Pop Music and help the experienced music lovers to rethink the additional art layer of music itself. In general, our project will mainly start on telling the story of the structure and lyrics interpretation. The first part would be a compared structure analysis of our database, and then we would start to choose sample music to do further explanation. The first step would allow the users to differentiate the similarity and difference among five genres. It also shows the various possibilities of song structure in one genre. Later by studying the specific songs, the user could find that the repeat pattern of pop music both in structure and lyrics. After exploring this part, the users could take advantage of the pattern to build his or her new song efficiently. During the process, we would apply the same color which shown in different diagrams to help strengthen the userâ€™s memory. And the sample song explanation could also combine with the related song tracks to enrich the understandings.
