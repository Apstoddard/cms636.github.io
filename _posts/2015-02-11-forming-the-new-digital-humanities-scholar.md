The example on the Holocaust testimony videos and potential ethical problems that may arise in their computational analysis demonstrates the need for a balance between computation and humanities approaches to analyze large-scale humanities data in an acceptable, meaningful fashion. Consequently, digital humanities (at least in its current early stage) require humanities scholars to often collaborate with computer scientists. This collaboration itself is a new and productive trend, but in my opinion, it only seems like a **temporary solution**, or a second-best option.

Although collaboration between the two disciplines is critical for the initiation of digital humanities, this gap (comparable to the gap between scholars and data catalogers mentioned in the first chapter) needs to be closed for the discipline to fully mature. One recurring concept among all the chapters seems to be the emergence of **a new computer scientist/humanist hybrid** position. This person not only has to be equipped with both the computation and critical humanities skillsets, but also has to be able to marry these skills to generate new tools that will develop digital humanities as a new paradigm.  

But of course, the training of the new digital humanities scholar will give rise to many questions: Who raise these individuals; computer scientists or humanities scholars? Will simply providing individuals with the discrete skillsets be enough for them to synthesize them to create novel ideas? What form of novel education needs to be provided to equip individuals with this synthesis capability?

As is the case with any new paradigm, the establishment of digital humanities will require new modes of education to form its own unique form of scholar. The one advantage digital humanities has, though, is that most of the tools resulting from the aforementioned CS/humanities collaborations tend to carry the potential for use in educational settings.
