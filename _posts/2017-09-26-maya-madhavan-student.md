Hi Everyone! I'm Maya, a senior Math Major and Economics Minor at Wellesley. As a student at a liberal arts college, I've taken quite a few humanities classes on top of my main coursework and am here to get an interdisciplinary perspective on what I've learned. I was abroad all of last year studying math at Oxford University in the UK, so I'm excited to learn more about modernizing historical scholarship.
