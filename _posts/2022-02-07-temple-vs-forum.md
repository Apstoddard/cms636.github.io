## What is a Museum?

In the end this chapter leaves more questions than answers as to what a museum is. We are given a number of definitions, historical and contemporary, and left with the realization that none of them quite seem to capture every museum open today. I thought the most poignant question concerned whether museums should be a "temple" for displaying the beauty of its collection or a "forum" for discussion sparked by its collection. This also ties into the question of to what degree a museum is defined by its collection. Certainly a temple of beauty requires beautiful objects, but a forum for discussion may be more defined by the people participating. The secretary of the MFA in the early 1900s is quoted as saying museums of science are essentially schools, and museums of art essentially temples, yet many contemporary art museums are increasingly interested in interactivity and teaching. A great deal of modern art even questions constructions of beauty, which further complicates the vision of an art museum as a temple of beauty. The authors do suggest that the museums of today have been generally shifting more toward the "forum" model, which does seem to be the general trend. 

## Before Museums: The Curiosity Cabinet as Metamorphe

Bowry presents a vision of a curiosity cabinet as a sort of inherently living collection, not one that happens to involve objects that move and change but one that is defined by the way its objects move and change and indeed relate to one another and to the collector. The act of collecting is almost secondary to the act of categorization in this view. She argues that this makes cabinets distinct from and therefore more than "mere embryonic museums." However, this objection seems to misunderstand just how alive a modern museum can be itself. 

There is less emphasis nowadays on direct metamorphosis of the collection, and on the personal relations to a single curator. Interaction directly with the collection has frequently been supplanted by interaction with auxiliary materials designed for the exhibit. Through new technologies we can endlessly construct change and transformation, allowing visitors to see how objects in the collection were built or even to experiment with techniques used to create the objects. So the elements of metamorphosis and consumption are still there, but de-emphasized and shifted to the visitors rather than the collector. Perhaps viewing modern museums through the lens of curiosity cabinets in their full complexity can clarify and shape the way we understand museums.
