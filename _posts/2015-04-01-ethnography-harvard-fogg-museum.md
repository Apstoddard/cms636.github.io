I'm going to start out describing the experience of this museum, and then perhaps ways that it could be improved.

The Fogg museum starts by presenting a very simple exterior. It's made of brick, it has some stairs leading up, and a reasonably sized but not attention-stealing sign. It looks like this:

The museum then opens up to a very severe and simple open room. It has big columns, a lot of glass at the top that makes me think of an Apple store, which is not to my mind the most inviting.

The first thing that strikes you about the interior of the museum is that there is no obvious place to start. The admissions spot is tucked into an alcove on the far left wall, and there are galleries that are more easily accessed. I don't have any good photos of this for reasons that I will explain soon. My friend and I actually walked into two galleries before realizing we were supposed to have a visitor's pass, which one of the many museum workers asked us to show and then pointed us to admissions.

Here's the thing: this museum feels like being on a grade-school trip. The museum staff are all in suits and ties, with big white CIA-style earpieces for their radios. It's unnerving. Maybe that's just because I went on a weekday afternoon with a friend, but the lack of people in the museum meant that the museum staff more or less followed us through each gallery. I felt like I couldn't talk, or that the staff might bark at me for misinterpreting the art on the walls.
