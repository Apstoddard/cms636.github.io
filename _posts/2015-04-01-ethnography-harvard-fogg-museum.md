I'm going to start out describing the experience of this museum, and then perhaps ways that it could be improved. I don't really know much about how to do an ethnography, but I am pretty wordy, so there's a short version and a longer version. The really relevant thing here is feeling comfortable in the museum, which this musuem does very poorly.

The Fogg museum starts by presenting a very simple exterior.

The museum then opens up to a very severe and modern open room.

The short version is as follows:

The museum was unwelcoming. It is almost entirely white, the rooms are very quiet, and the museum staff are dressed like CIA agents and stare after you the whole time like you're going to steal something. I felt noticeably more relaxed when I left the museum, that's how bad their system is. The admissions desk is hidden, such that my group actually wandered through half the museum before being asked to buy admission tickets. 

The museum uses very little technology. It could benefit, I think, from cutting down on hawklike observing staff, and perhaps using the cameras (which they have installed) or proximity sensors to deter patrons from damaging the art. It completely takes you out of the enjoyment of an extraordinary collection of art when someone who was standing outside of the gallery walks in to stare at you and make sure you don't screw anything up.

Also, the museum could use music. Anything ambient, low, something that makes it feel less like a crime to talk to your friend while in the museum. Something to welcome you into the museum, like a TV screen that suggests you start at the admissions and then gives a brief description of the museum's galleries, would be extremely helpful. I don't think the museum's lack of technology is necessarily a problem, but it could certainly benefit from using something more inviting than the open room and staring staff that it currently employs.

The long version:

The first thing that strikes you about the interior of the museum is that there is no obvious place to start. The admissions spot is tucked into an alcove on the far left wall, and there are galleries that are more easily accessed. I don't have any good photos of this for reasons that I will explain soon. My friend and I actually walked into two galleries before realizing we were supposed to have a visitor's pass, which one of the many museum workers asked us to show and then pointed us to admissions.

Here's the thing: this museum feels like being on a grade-school trip. The museum staff are all in suits and ties, with big white CIA-style earpieces for their radios. It's unnerving. Maybe that's just because I went on a weekday afternoon with a friend, but the lack of people in the museum meant that the museum staff more or less followed us through each gallery. I felt like I couldn't talk, or that the staff might bark at me for misinterpreting the art on the walls. It was threatening and unwelcoming. None of them ever cracked a smile except when two were talking to each other, in the middle of the room as they watched my friend and I move from piece to piece. 

The museum uses very little extra technology. The list of upcoming events was on a TV screen so that it could be updated, but apart from that and a projector to show film pieces in galleries, it was mostly older art and a very simple museum experience. I did not see any visitors using anything else to aid in their experience, nor did the museum staff suggest that there was any augmented experiene. 

The biggest, best change to this museum would be make the museum staff feel less like they're there to catch you. It was unnerving and I felt far more relaxed once we left the museum. Replacing human guards with proximity sensors, or live-monitoring the many security cameras that were already in place seems like perhaps a better solution. Possibly even asking the staff to smile slightly more would improve the experience.

Similarly, some sound and color would improve the museum greatly. It felt like a crime to talk in the museum, and many of the galleries were a sterile, stark white such that when one gallery was a muted gray I felt like there was a huge amount of color and personality added. That's all I needed. Just not white all the time, and perhaps some light background music so that it didn't feel so sacriligeous to talk.

Anyways, my point is that this museum did not necessarily need an augmented reality experience to become better. Some subtle uses of technology to make the museum feel more welcoming would be the greatest improvement to the museum experience I could imagine.
