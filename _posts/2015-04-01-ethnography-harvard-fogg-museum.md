I'm going to start out describing the experience of this museum, and then perhaps ways that it could be improved.

The Fogg museum starts by presenting a very simple exterior.

The museum then opens up to a very severe and modern open room.

The short version is as follows:

The museum was unwelcoming. It is almost entirely white, the rooms are very quiet, and the museum staff are dressed like CIA agents and stare after you the whole time like you're going to steal something. I felt noticeably more relaxed when I left the museum, that's how bad their system is. The admissions desk is hidden, and difficult to 

The first thing that strikes you about the interior of the museum is that there is no obvious place to start. The admissions spot is tucked into an alcove on the far left wall, and there are galleries that are more easily accessed. I don't have any good photos of this for reasons that I will explain soon. My friend and I actually walked into two galleries before realizing we were supposed to have a visitor's pass, which one of the many museum workers asked us to show and then pointed us to admissions.

Here's the thing: this museum feels like being on a grade-school trip. The museum staff are all in suits and ties, with big white CIA-style earpieces for their radios. It's unnerving. Maybe that's just because I went on a weekday afternoon with a friend, but the lack of people in the museum meant that the museum staff more or less followed us through each gallery. I felt like I couldn't talk, or that the staff might bark at me for misinterpreting the art on the walls. It was threatening and unwelcoming. None of them ever cracked a smile except when two were talking to each other, in the middle of the room as they watched my friend and I move from piece to piece. 

The museum uses very little extra technology. The list of upcoming events was on a TV screen so that it could be updated, but apart from that and a projector to show film pieces in galleries, it was mostly older art and a very simple museum experience. I did not see any visitors using anything else to aid in their experience, nor did the museum staff suggest that there was any augmented experiene.

The biggest, best change to this museum would be make the museum staff feel less like they're there to catch you. It was unnerving and I felt far more relaxed once we left the museum. Some direction to the admissions desk would also have been nice. I wasn't even sure where I should go until a person asked me to get a museum pass.
