The reading illustrates different ways in which the establishment of digital archives is not only about translating and transferring existing material into digital form and constructing a digital framework and interface, but instead allows as well as necessitates rethinking of archiving. How new technologies have, and will, affect and shape the ways in which we conceptualize and treat memories is also alluded to.

The digital world, with its binary units, intrinsic linkages, and transitive nature, is undoubtedly very different from traditional means of storing and archiving information. These differences offer new advantages and perspectives, but also introduces new issues to solve and deliberate on. The transitive nature of digital information and communication is especially inconsistent with the very notion of archives, as previously and perhaps presently still established. While it felt logical to assume that digital archives are more durable or reliable than the physical, after last week and this week's readings, this idea has definitely been well challenged.
