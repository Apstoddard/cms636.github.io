[The Bourgeoisie and the Common People](https://lemaraislife.omeka.net/exhibits/show/bourgeoisie-and-common-people)

We chose to look at the differences between rich and poor in 18th and 19th century France, and how that affected the revolutions in 1789 and 1848.

First translating the texts to English with the help of Google, we then searched through the data and grouped the images by activity. We ended up with 40 pictures in total, distributed over the categories 'Childhood', 'Everyday Life', 'Work', 'Leisure', and 'Conflict'. Most of the images are illustrations, as photography was rather rare at the time.
