- What is the difference between staged photography and non-staged, besides adherence to reality? In its intrinsic value or artistic representation.
- What do you think of the current immaterial images, digital photo of real objects and digital images that are computer generated? As “Images in the post-photographic era can no longer be guaranteed as visual truth—or even as signifiers with stable meaning and value.”(WJT Mitchell) 
- There seems to be a sense of objectivity/reality delivered through photography(non-digital ones), but that isn’t always the case. As a curator, how do you respond to the falsified notion of absolute reality in the curatorial narratives and specificities like wall texts?
- What are the decisive factors when choosing the size for photography in the exhibition?
