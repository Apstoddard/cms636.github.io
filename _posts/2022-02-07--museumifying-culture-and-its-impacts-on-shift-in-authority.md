## Commentary // What is a Museum

"What is a Museum" is an intriguing introduction to the history and roles museums have occupied over the past couple hundred years. The number of museuem definitions we receive throughout the reading are prescribed by a fundamental difference in perspective of what museums are and should be -- educational, cultural, civic, or even divine institutions. Different perspectives have become popular in different times, perhaps as a reflection of the currently existing social order. As an example, even now, as sentiment shifts towards transparency and open-sourceness in an age of increasing digital information, we see the rise of civic museums that have mirrored these attitudes to become physical, open-source spaces for their communities in times of need. As globalization nears completion and we see immigrants and their second-generation children born, I find it particularly interesting that in parallel the discussion of "museumifying culture" has arisen. In a time where personal identity and cultural roots have naturally become so prevalent of a topic, I am pleased to notice its impacts on museums and their newfound responsibility to develop museums and exhibits "in tandem with the people the history is about". I imagine that representing culture in institutions such as museums is no longer so much of a foreign activity showcasing "exotic" collections, as it is now a relatable and memorable activity for its own people. I wonder if trends like these have the ability to influence beyond cultural institutions, and perhaps even reflect into more formal art museums. While museums today employ both exclusive curation and audience engagement, I wonder if exclusive curation will ever cede to exist as relatability and "open-source" opinion become so important in our day and age.
