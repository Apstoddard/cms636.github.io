# Attempting to Reinvent the Timeline

When approaching this project, our team decided we wanted to consider the nature of the timeline itself, and come up with a representation that was able to describe more than just the linear progression of time. We considered three different ways of approaching this:

- Conveying the Positivity or Negativity of the Event
- Indicating the Idea of Spiraling/Violent Cycles of Aggression
- Communicating how Events Build on Each Other/Unfold

We developed these into a number of potential visualizations, each one focused on one or two of the concepts.

## Positivity or Negativity of the Event

The US-Iran relationship has been incredibly tension filled for both sides, and each event that happened on the timeline had an effect on how the US and Iran saw each other. In order to properly tell the story of the two countries, we needed a visualization that showed some sort of emotional impact.
Our first instinct was to use NLP sentiment analysis to determine the positivity or negativity of the event based on tone. To represent the data, we wanted to create a visualization that would make you feel the increases/decreases in negativity. We started with a line that could looked like a sound wave, and would get "noiser" as tensions increased (see Sketches 1). We also considered adding an audio component to the visualization, where, when users moused over specific areas of the timeline, they would hear a heart beat faster/slower depending on the amount of tension at that time. These ideas were also highly transferable to other concepts, and we attempted to combine this with a number of our other ones.

However, we ran into difficulty exactly defining what we meant by "positivity" and "negativity." Are they decreases/increases in tensions? Moves towards/away from war? Simply the emotion conveyed by the briefing book? Because of our uncertainity of this definition, we decided to change the axis to how much the event was in favor of the US or its allies versus in favor of Iran or its allies. 

## Spiraling and Cycles of Aggression

We started with the spiral on a conceptual basis of moving away from a linear representation of time to a circular one. 

In the end, we worried that enforcing the image of spirals and cycles on the data could be artificially fitting a narrative onto the data that the data did not necessarily represent, and so we pivoted away from a literal spiral. We did keep the idea of changing angles to indicate benefits for/against the US or Iran, as we felt that literally moving to one side would be an impactful and meaningful visual.
