![MZ_Edit_01.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/MZ_Edit_01.jpg) Meesh Zucker is a 2nd year Masters student in City Planning and Urban Studies at MIT. Her research explores how social identities exist and interact with the built environment, particularly in how to spatialize and map lesser-known histories of communities often found buried in the archives.  She dreams of creating public spaces curated by human desire and reflective of the diverse community narratives that shape them.
