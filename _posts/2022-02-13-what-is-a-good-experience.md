**THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY**
This piece offers meticulous instructions to curate experiences, one that is classified as intangible. The textbook positive senses-engaging harmonious and memorable thematic experience read a little bit vanilla. I kind of wanted to challenge the perfection conveyed in the passage, and felt they are too good to be good, making it hard to shed the spotlight on a specific element,  or it’s because I’ve never been to a perfect museum.   
**FIRST-TIME AND REPEAT VISITORS:**
I appreciate that at the beginning Dorn and Polegato talk about the museum experience as a social bonding experience. The clarification illuminates a shift in the programmatic curation in museums, especially in the time of social media silos. However, the demographic results from questionnaires seem problematic to me. SInce it is not mandatory, intuitively, retired people have the time and patience to do that, and so do females. The data collected might hold some truth but not that big difference. I have a question regarding targeting audiences, not out of critique but genuine curiosity, is there a rationale/exigency for a museum for both male and female? Why does gender become the segmenting focus when projecting future audiences?
