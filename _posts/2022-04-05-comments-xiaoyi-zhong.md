The mix reality app visually exhibits the connections between collections and history, geography, etc, which greatly expands the potential of the current museum that mostly rely on the curation of physical space. It can easily create contextual relationships between visitors and cultural content and can add a social and historical dimension to the experience.

Meanwhile, I am also thinking about how AR can used to reduced the cognitive loads that many visitors may experience when they enter an exhibition that they are not familiar with. Most textual information of the collections may add too much burdens on visitors' cognition due to lack of prior knowledge, which makes them easily get bored of the exhibition. However, with the help of AR, those textual information can be transformed into other formats, such as audio and pictures, visually pointing out the hidden connections and message. Therefore, the collaborative interface and multimodal interaction methods create a multisensory tour, combining multiple interaction modes, such as sound, video, movement, which enhance the engagement of vistors. Because the user's visual, auditory, and tactile senses are influenced by the physical and virtual environment.
