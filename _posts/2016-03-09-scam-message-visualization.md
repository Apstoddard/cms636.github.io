title: Scam message visualization
---

I noticed a number of patterns in the spam messages, particularly the subject lines. Most of the spam messages either fill into the category of being very formal and attempting to impersonate someone or they are very friendly and try to act like they have met you before. A few examples of these two categories can be seen in these subject lines: "FROM ALINCO SECURITY COMPANY”, "DO REPLY: FEDEX PAYMENT LODGEMENT OF FUNDS", "YOUR BROTHER”, and "Hello Dear Friend.” I think it would be interesting to try to visualize the messages as grouped by there level of formality. You count the number of occurrences of formal and informal words in the subject of each message and then plot each email based on how formal it is. Other meta data about the message could also be incorporated to added additional axes to the graph such as geography location of the sender or length of the emails.
