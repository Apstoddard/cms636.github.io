For this project, I filtered the spreadsheet with many words and ultimately decided to use portraits since they had a number not too low or high so I could show something without looking at hundreds of pictures. 

Then I divided them between the 16th,17th,18th, and 19th Century collections. I hoped that the purpose of these collections were to allow people to notice differences in how portraits looked and how they have evolved over the centuries. For expanding the project I would try to use more portraits and analyze their similarities and differences to tell a clearer story of the centuries based on portraits.
