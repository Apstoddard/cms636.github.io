Existing ReFrame Sign 

I thought this ReFrame sign for Paul Gauguin’s painting “Poèmes Barbares” works well. The description highlights the controversy surrounding Gauguin’s sexual relationships with adolescents in Tahiti in the 1890s. The ReFrame sign not only explores the painting from a historical standpoint, but also incorporates a perspective from a contemporary point of view. This helps the viewer think more critically about the painting, making them wonder more deeply about things such as power imbalances, gender roles, and so forth. The painting therefore transcends being just “oil on canvas”. It is instead a dynamic work that can act as a starting point for having difficult conversations that continue to exist in today’s society. The ReFrame sign also highlights further research on the artwork, emphasizing an x-ray of the painting which helps in expanding our understanding of the painting, or approaching it from a new lens. The x-ray reveals that the artist’s initial intentions for the painting (a landscape) were actually very different from what he ended up deciding to paint. These layers of past paintings and erasures are made visible to the museum visitor through the ReFrame sign. This makes the viewer wonder: Why did the artist decide to paint this subject as opposed to his initial intentions? What does this say about the value he placed on the subject of this painting? Does this information change our interpretation and perception of the piece?  The ReFrame further encourages us to delve further into this painting by scanning a QR code which leads us to further research on the piece.

New ReFrame Concept 

These objects are various tombstones from Egypt and Iran through various periods (Seljuk period, Abbasid period, Tulunid period). The descriptions of these objects explore these remnants of tombstones and give the viewer a bit of overview and context. We are told how one inscription translates to the “soul’s entry to eternal life”, and another tombstone of an individual “records her affiliation with one of the Arab tribes that had participated in the Muslim conquest of Egypt”. However, the descriptions mainly seem to focus on the development of Arabic calligraphy as an academic discipline. The visitor also comes to learn that these tombstones were part of  27 Egyptian tombstones that were purchased by a Harvard archaeologist in 1890 from a cemetery in southern Cairo. I feel that there seems to be a tension between the significance and importance of these tombstones in a religious and cultural context, and the way the description seems to take a more scholarly/academic perspective. The description seems to acknowledge that these tombstones are religiously significant, but we mainly read a more surface-level analysis of the tombstone. These tombstones are markers of a community, spirituality, and cultural heritage, and are taken and preserved by scholars from the Western world. To what extent are we valuing academic research from a euro-centric perspective over the cultural value that these objects have to the communities they were taken from? I think these artifacts need ReFrame signs to further explore the significance of these tombstones. What was the role of these tombstones in the given religious/cultural context? What is the meaning of death in these contexts? The ReFrame design prototype below helps to explore these ideas further by adding religious, cultural, and historical context.
