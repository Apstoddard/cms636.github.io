## Distant/close, Macro/micro, Surface/depth
When working with large data sets, one has the possibility to both look at the large picture and individual entries of data. The two perspectives compliment each other, as one can both find large trends that describe the overall situation and might help predict (guess about) the future, while the micro perspective affords more intimacy with the data, providing anecdotes and a more relatable view.

## Humanities Gaming
Though previously often looked down upon by scholars as toys and unintelligent ways to pass time, games, as examplified by the wondrous Magnat de Théâtre (Theater Tycoon) game concept, can be a good way of engaging with data and creating interest in important topics. When done correctly, games can be a very visceral experience that highlight the conflict and drama hidden in data, that might be difficult to get across using less interactive means. Of course, as any technology, it is important to think through when to, and when not to, make a game, as gamification (that is, forcing game mechanics upon intrinsically non-game-like activities) seldom works beyond a brief wow-factor, if at all.
