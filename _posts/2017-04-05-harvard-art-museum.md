The place I visited during this week is Harvard art museum. Most of the visitors, to my knowledge, is the Harvard visitors and Harvard students (It is free for Harvard students). It is a very traditional museum that only technologies that used in the institution is the audio tour guide. However, the website is well made to help people browse the collections in advance or for the review. They even selected several hotspots to help people to plan their tour and know what to expect.

Like other museum, it has its own coffee shop. We sometimes would visit the café with no intention to see the exhibition because they made great coffee there. We even held a group meeting their once to get away from our studio for a moment.

The biggest highlight in the Harvard art museum, except for its profound collections, would be its built environment. It was expanded and renovated by Renzo Piano, who is a master in museum architecture. Looking from outside, one side of this museum (the side near Harvard yard) is old school architecture, while the other side is modern. For the interior, it’s also the combination of tradition and modern. As we can see in the picture, the first and second floor is colonnade and the upper floors are replaced by modern material – glass and steel, repeating the rhythm of colonnade.
