title: Remapping Apps
author: Yichen Jia
---
Concept:
There are so many apps available on the app store nowadays that can help people do all sort of things. However, it is hard for people to find the app they want to use sometime because of how app store organizes and display its apps (based on categories and search engine). The project will redesign the organization of those apps based on the assumption that each appâ€™s function is related to the function of a physical object (either supplementing it or replacing it). 

Outcome:
A website that shows the interior of a room (either in 2d drawing or 3d model), with a lot of daily objects displayed in it. When the users mouse-over the object they will see a list of apps that are associated with the object. (For instance, notes-taking/to-do apps will be linked to a notebook on the table, closet organizing apps will be linked to a closet in the room, health eatting apps will be linked to lunchbox/tableware)

Ideally, the website will also include an user interface for app creators to link their app to one of the objects or creating new objects that can represent their app. 

Questions:
Mapping digital products to physical objects that have similar/associated functions but are categorized in different ways.
Challenge the tradtional digital humanities process of "physcial to digital" to "digtial to digital" by recognizing something inherentially digital as part of our culture.


Target audience:
People who are looking for apps of specific functions
App creators who want to showcase the function of their app in an innovative format

General interests:
Web-based 3d visualization
