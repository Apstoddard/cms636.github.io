Sonification seems like a powerful tool for understanding data. We can use a specific sound to indicate an event or concept. In this way, it functions as an alert or audio icon. Alternatively, we can map data to sound attributes such as volume, pitch, etc. Both these approaches have analogs in the visual world (ex. icons, visual variables). 

However, sound is more powerful than the visual in at least one way - it can convey emotion ambiently (i.e. without drawing attention away from the work itself). While visual techniques like color and provoking imagery can also do this, they may capture attention from audience and take it away from the main work. A specific example is background music. Background music can set a mood or convey emotion, but doesn't detract from the work itself.

With this in mind, I think one interesting application of sonification to our virtual reality museum project would be generating background music based on the content of each museum room. By performing sentiment analysis and extracting keywords from the descriptions, we can judge the emotion of the work. Then, we can select from a pre-determined set of music (or generate music, if we are more daring) as the background music for the room. The hope is that the appropriate music choice would enhance the experience, reinforce the emotion conveyed by the art, and avoid detracting from the art itself.
