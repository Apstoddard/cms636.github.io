Humans have always tried to augment their environments to be easier to understand, navigate, and interact with. As Lev Manovich mentioned we have always signs and other static labels to add a layer of information to our environments. With recent advances in augmented and virtual reality I think that our environment has started to matter less and less as we spend more time processing information that is part of the new virtual layer instead or the physical layer. With new augmented reality devices physical spaces can be augmented to suit any purpose from a movie theater to an art gallery or a classroom. In general, I think that this will cause our physical worlds to be come less important and simpler while our augmented worlds become more exciting and complex. Virtual reality takes this to an extreme by completely replacing the idea of having multiple layers of reality and creates an entirely new reality independent of your physical environment.
