I first want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this reading, and I thought the author of this piece was really skilled at depicting their hopes for the future of museums. I found myself dreaming of all of the ways that a museum could become a public space that people are more excited about investing in. I think the notion of having museums become sort of an indoor extension of “public parks” and adapting to offering new services in ways that libraries have is crucial towards that investment. As I was beginning this reading, to me “Museum” still held the connotation of a space that is for special occasions. With most of the museums I’ve been to recently, I feel that after spending a day there I have “gained” all that I could out of the space, and couldn’t see myself returning relatively frequently. It would be great to see these spaces shift towards becoming places of public life and interpersonal connection as the article describes.


This piece also expanded my definition of an exhibit. When the author talked about supermarkets, clothing stores, and sidewalks all becoming exhibition spaces, I was brought back to a moment back in March of 2020. The night MIT made the statement that we would all be leaving campus due to Covid-19, lobby 7 was filled with all sorts of activities. Groups singing together, papers hung on the pillars so people could write down their fears during that time of uncertainty. Though the word never occurred to me at the time, I now see that these were very much exhibits! In that instance, lobby 7 became a museum, and it offered the public a space to pour their hearts out simply because they needed to. I think the shift towards a more personal and meaningful museum experience could give them potential to contribute to and even define what it means to live in a community.
