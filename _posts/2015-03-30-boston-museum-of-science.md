In the Boston Museum of Science, almost every single exhibit is both technological and interactive.

Why is the case? Well, the **primary demographic attending the museum is children** (they constituted over half the attendees). Thus, to keep kids interested, tech-heavy interactive exhibits are ubiquitous.

The Museum of Science uses nearly every form of digital media imaginable. There are **large screens, multiple screens, games, audio tours, and a huge number of interactive displays**.

_Iâ€™m sorry if some of the angles in the photos below are strange. I tried not to photograph any of the attendees, which required me to take pictures at inconvenient angles._

Many exhibits feature a computer with a set of buttons or levers to interact with it.

Interestingly, even with so much digital technology, the most popular exhibits were the purely mechanical, or mechanical/digital hybrids. **These were almost always occupied by a group of attendees while the purely digital exhibits were often abandoned - an unexpected use of the space**. Some of the mechanical displays included a **Rube Goldberg machine, a set of mirrors, a footrace track with sensors to track runners, a series of tubes with different scents, a heating-cooling panel, an enclosed artificial dust storm, and a magnetic canvas**.

The variety of technological exhibits in the museum was staggering. The Museum of Science is refreshingly different in that almost every exhibit is interactive and tech-heavy. For a digital humanist, the Museum of Science shows the value in leaving traditional museum technology (ex. apps, audio tours, screens) and embracing creative, interactive displays which combine the digital and mechanical.
