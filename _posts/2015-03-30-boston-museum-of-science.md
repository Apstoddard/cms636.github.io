In the Boston Museum of Science, almost every single exhibit is both technological and interactive.

Why is the case? Well, the primary demographic attending the museum is children (they constituted over half the attendees). Thus, to keep kids interested, tech-heavy interactive exhibits are ubiquitous.

The Museum of Science uses nearly every form of digital media imaginable. There are large screens, multiple screens, games, audio tours, and a huge number of interactive displays.

_Iâ€™m sorry if some of the angles in the photos below are strange. I tried not to photograph any of the attendees, which required me to take pictures at inconvenient angles._

Interestingly, even with so much digital technology, the most popular exhibits were the purely mechanical, or mechanical/digital hybrids. These were almost always occupied by a group of attendees while the purely digital exhibits were often abandoned - an unexpected use of the space. Some of the mechanical displays included a Rube Goldberg machine, a set of mirrors, a footrace track, a series of tubes with different scents, a heating-cooling panel, an enclosed artificial dust storm, and a magnetic canvas.

The variety of technological exhibits in the museum was staggering. The Museum of Science is a refreshingly different in that almost every exhibit is interactive and tech-heavy. For a digital humanist, the Museum of Science shows the value in leaving traditional museum technology (ex. apps, audio tours, screens) and embracing creative, interactive displays which combine the digital and mechanical.
