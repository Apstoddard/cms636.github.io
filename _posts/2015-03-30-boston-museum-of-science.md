__NOTE: I notice that Karleigh also went to the Museum of Science and discussed its demographic (children) and some of its technology (interactive exhibits). So, in order to avoid repeating information, I will discuss the interior/exterior of the museum, an unexpected behavior, one possible frustration with the museum, and provide more examples of technology__

## Welcome and Interior/Exterior
Although the exterior of the museum building is not very distinctive and the lobby is quite typical (ticketing area and information booth), the museum distinguishes itself by featuring a large T-Rex outside the building and an elaborate Rube Goldberg Machine on the inside.

## Unexpected Behavior
Interestingly, attendees tended to flock to displays which were mechanical, or mechanical/digital hybrids, rather than the purely digital display.

This screen in the food exhibit was abandoned for a long time.

The magnetic canvas station had many children playing with it.


## Possible Frustration
While the museum does a great job captivating attendees and encouraging social interaction (ex. children race against each other in the motion exhibit), many of the attendees, adults included, did not pay attention to the informational content.

The audio tour phones were rarely used, and the sheer number of displays caused attendees to avoid reading informational boards, and instead move on to play with the next exhibit.

Most exhibits have these phones which you can pick up for an audio tour.

The wind exhibit combined text with an interactive display - children tended to play with the display for a bit, get bored, and run off before reading/listening to any content.

## More Technology
### Mechanical

### Digital
