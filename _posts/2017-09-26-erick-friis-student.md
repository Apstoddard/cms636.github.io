Hey there! I'm Erick Friis, a junior Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (6-2) major here at MIT. I'm concentrating in Comparative Media Studies (CMS), which landed me in this class on digital humanities. Aside from class, I work part-time at Sonos designing and prototyping smart speaker concepts, I lead the teaching staff for Engineering, Innovation, and Design (6.902), and am an active member of my fraternity's leadership.
