The Museum of Science would greatly benefit it they took some of Lev’s ideas of augmented space into account. They tried with the whole audio tour exhibits and interactive screens everywhere but they really haven’t broken through the 3rd dimension, which is the current metric for curation (honestly though, it feels 2d).

Augmented space, as Lev describes it, is kind of like a controlled sensory overload where different information is being simultaneously conveyed to you through several dimensions. Using technology like AR or cellular interaction is a really quick and dirty way to do this but it’s not the only way. A really cool example which is mentioned is the Jewish Museum Berlin where the architecture of the building itself was decided by the layout of pre-war jewish neighborhoods. This is a very unique way because it doesn’t rely on new tech, but only on someone’s imagination.

In my ethnography I complained about the lack of modern technology in the museum but I also think that the Museum of Science could draw inspiration from The Jewish Museum Berlin and perhaps reorganize some of its exhibits such that the space itself conveys knowledge. One potential exhibit that comes to mind is an audio exhibit that demonstrates the properties of waves and interference by having the user stand at different parts of the room while listening to some sounds. Another example that uses space could be a scale model of the solar system. This would allow the user to really appreciate the relative distances between interstellar bodies, all without having to read a single sentence.
