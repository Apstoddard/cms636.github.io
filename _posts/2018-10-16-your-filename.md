## A Summary of Two Emerging Areas in Digital Humanities

****Augmented Editions and Fluid Textuality

This method has many advantages. It allows for historical texts to be transcribed and reconstructed over an extended period of time. When thinking about religious texts, in particular, one an see how these texts have grown and developed in many facets since their initial origination. The ability to recreate different versions of such important texts fosters a sense of inclusion and collaboration, and ultimately maximizes the intellectual investigation of these documents as a means of displaying these varying interpretations. Collaboration is further fostered through the fluidity of texts by showing a move from the individual voice to that of the "collaborative, collective, and aggregated voice." Readers of these texts can now engage with many versions of the text in one sitting. In addition to a more engaged and well-versed audience, the augmented editions of texts adds another dimension to editing practices. And it is because of these improved editing practices that authors now have the ability to allow for further understanding of texts through features such as sequence, juxtaposition, ordering, navigating, and analyzing.

****Distant/Close, Macro/Micro, Surface/Depth

The juxtaposition of distant and close readings lies in the epistomelogical approach. Distant readings have the ability to summarize a large quantity of texts in a way that allows researchers to detect large-scale trends, patterns, and relationships. Close readings have a much deeper hermeneutics approach in that it pays close attentin to the details of a text. However, rather than looking at these two readings seperately, there has now been a move towards the conjunction of the two concepts. Digital humanists are now able to "toggle" betweend differing views of the data by zooming in and out. This toggling of views leads to the ability to search for large-scale patterns while simultaneously focusing on detailed analysis.
