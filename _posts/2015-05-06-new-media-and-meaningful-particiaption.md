I enjoyed reading this article, and found myself agreeing with much of its content.  For sometime, I have believed that the current educational system is outdated, and that the integration of new media could drastically enhance and improve how people absorb knowledge.  I particularly liked Henry Jenskin’s comment that, “The institutional and industrialized practices of mass media allow for the mass production and circulation of culture but often at the expense of our abilities to meaningfully participate in those processes at a grassroots level.” I found this interesting, as while media and the web have allowed for the circulation of knowledge and scholarly material, there is often a barrier between those who are producing material and those who are simply consuming.  

For much of my life, I have been one of these passive consumers, and only recently, since coming to Wellesley, do I have I begun to participate and add to the material I am given.  Most of my high school education was fairly traditional, and relied heavily on passive consumption, reading the materials my teachers provided and relaying and their interpretations of the text.  Since coming to Wellesley, I have enjoyed the freedom afforded to me in the classroom, both in the variety of material provided and the multitude of platforms that allow me to share my opinions, artwork, and ideas.  Additionally, my high school did not provide classes on new media, nor did they utilize new media in the classroom.  Over the past two years, I have had the opportunity to take some introductory computer science classes, and now have the tools contribute to new media in interesting ways through my work at the Media lab, in the classroom, etc.
