## â€œDigital Storytelling in Museums: Observations and Best Practices"

The author made many interesting observations that I have also noticed, such as how people may look at sources that are not entirely reliable, but they still form their own opinions on whether they believe it to be trustworthy or not. Among all the well-written strategic thoughts, my favorite was that good storytelling requires good editing. While it generally spoke about how not all experiences should be made interactive, I interpreted the phrase as when you present a story, not all the details in the story should be expressed in extreme details as it can confuse the audience. Instead, the most impactful details should be emphasized rather than every single one.

## __Design is Storytelling__

For our project, I think the storyboard would be helpful by helping us connect the different stations that we would have. It would help others connect to each one more instead of only finding one interesting or finding all the different parts confusing.
