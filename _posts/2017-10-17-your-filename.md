Cartigraphies of Time: ##


Rosenberg and Grafton reminds us that tracing time is pretty nascent. Also, the main form that  represents time is simply line. And this form has not changed much over a long period of time. I find it intriguing how time and space are inseparatable. We cannot tell time without mentioning space. This makes space a fundamental and perpetual basis of our idea of time. Due to this strong connection between space and time, our way of representing time using line makes a lot sense and seems intrinsic. It will probably stick around for a long time. 


Spatial Humanities: ##


The author analyzes the concept of space where all perspectives are dependent upon experiences unique to an individual , a community, or a period of time. He transitions into analyzing today's concept of space. Space, today, is a medium for the development of culture, a product and determinant of change. 
He presents the debates on GIS. Supporters of GIS, such as quantitative geographers, value its capacity to manage large data sets and visualize the results of spaital analysis. They see this as a potential to solve spatial problems and make data visual intuitive interpretation. On the other hand, opponents of GIS believe that the software unfairly favors certain conceptualization of the world. Further, they see it as inadequate for understanding societal complexity since it represents and perpetuates a particular view of political, economic, and social power. 
I can see where both sides come from. One side is eager to utilize GIS's potential while the other is more wary about its negative impact. GIS is an imperfect software used by imperfect users. It is a tool that can benefit society if used with good intention and moderation. Or it can be abused by those in power for personal gains. It is good that we have a debate on this tool to reevaluate its potential and set ethical constraints on its use. This debate further sparks the questions "What is knowledge?" and "How do we know if knowledge really exists when we see it?"
