## Rosenberg -- Keeley

I found Cartographies of Time an extremely interesting read, as it made me contemplate how I view time. I had never thought about how I visualized time, and didn't appreciate how engrained the linearity of time is in Western culture. Mitchell's insights into how spatial analogies permeate temporal insights is fascinating, in particular, his focus on the language we use when discussing events in time -- intervals, long, short, before, and after. These adjectives all refer to a linear representation of time. When I began to appreciate how engrained this representation is, I tried to visualize time in some other way. Instead of thinking of time as a linear process, I tried to think of it as cyclical or flexible. I found this virtually impossible, and thought Reynold's gave a convincing argument of how our cultural background significantly effects how we view time (http://consultingsuccess.org/wp/?page_id=1204).
