##  New Museum – New York 
##  Online presence review

For my museum review I have chosen the New Museum, NY as it is New York’s only dedicated Contemporary art museum. Overall their online presence is extremely rich and engaging providing a very attractive platform in the post-pandemic world while maintaining connectedness with the broader community through a multitude of resources beyond the their exhibits and visits (whether online or offline). The museum is also committed to serving the community through their partnerships and community initiatives/organizations. Overall, I found that the museum has an obove average community engagement as compared to other museums of this nature. Below I give an overview of some of the key aspects of the museum's experience. 

**Attractiveness post pandemic **

_Online exhibitions _
The museum has inaugurated an online series titled “New Art Online” that features a series of innovative online projects and new commissions by the museum. These online exhibitions take on various forms including a full interactive website or a simple PDF file with high quality scans of the works. The interactive exhibition websites showcase artworks or interesting customer journeys that allow the viewer to discover a new world through the platform. Some of the wayfinding requires you to be extremely curious and press on different buttons to explore and experiment the “exhibit” without being too prescriptive. I found this approach to be extremely engaging and providing a totally different digital experience than a much more static display of objects on a screen. Almost redefining the museum experience as we know it.

Other online exhibits were more structured and arranged into clearer categories however the topics discussed and media exhibited were similarly daring and intriguing.

_Online experiences _
In terms of catering for online experiences, the museum has done their best to be more inclusive to a multitude of audiences that would like to engage with the museum but are not able to visit in person. They offer online tours for groups and live public tours on both Zoom and Instagram live to cater for different demographics and requirements. The online tours are marketed as interactive learning experiences which can be tailored for any audiences and they are led by a teaching fellow expert in writing and journalism. Live public tours are exhibition specific and aim to engage in an interactive conversation with the broader community. Instagram live tours are more entertaining and aim to attract a different type of audience that is more responsive to such an approach. The events are marketed as “providing insights into featured artworks” and “behind the scenes details about the exhibit”. 

_Website information & display _
Similar to many other museums, the New Museum has updated their “Visit” page to include their detailed response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to their entry requirements, they provide a detailed list of guidelines and checks required before any visit. The museum also stipulates the availability of virtual & onsite tours for community groups and the general public. Onsite tours, however, have been canceled until further notice. 
Many websites today have a specific page or website banner that announces Covid policies, however, the museum has adopted a more subtle approach, its impact can be debated but at this point in the pandemic may not have that much of a large effect on attracting audiences. 

**Resources beyond visits**

_Digital Archive _
The New Museum has developed an online digital archive of its programs and institutional history. It offers a multitude of media including image, video, audio, publications and printed matter. The digital archive has a beautiful user experience and is structured around home, chronology and archive search user journeys.

Home: provides a more exploratory page structured into different sections including exhibitions, people, print, sounds, video and building initiative. This gives the user an open space to explore and play around with the archival materials in a less structured way. The sections are structured in spreads across the page with different formats that encourage exploration and discovery.

Chronology: is a more structured page that shows the museum’s history in a nicely curated manner. As the user scrolls down the page, they can follow the timeline with distinct annual markers on the right-hand-side of the page.

Archive search: is another structured page that provides a more practical and intentional search forum including a search bar and multiple filters to help the user reach the desired archival work easily and seamlessly. 

Overall, the digital archive is curated beautifully to provide delightful user journeys and engage different users.   

_Publications_ 
The museum’s Education and Engagement department produces publications in efforts to engage the broader public in research “about and with contemporary art and artists”. These publications are however, not free, and need to be purchased at the museum store. It strikes me as odd that in order to “engage” in this research – the public needs to pay for it. There is opportunity for the museum to release more targeted and shorter publications through online articles to enable this engagement. 

_Educator programs  _
The museum offers an array of interesting & free resources for educators to improve their classroom experience, including lesson plans, resources and workshops that could be used by any educator in the field. The program also features professional development courses that could be beneficial for educators. I believe this program is effective in engaging educators with the museum’s community and ensures participation of educators from different backgrounds further strengthening the museum’s potential presence in community classrooms. 


**Serving and engaging communities **

_Partners _
The museum partners with both community and school partners to “cultivate contemporary art experiences that foster growth through inquiry and connect people with themselves, one another, and the wider world”. The partnerships revolve around community involvement through art projects, talks and workshops. With schools, the museum contributes with teachers to enhance the learning experience for students in the classroom.  

_Initiatives/ organizations_ 
The museum successfully created / is associated with multiple organizations that promote contemporary art in a variety of way and engage with the broader art community through educational, supportive and preservative ways. Two examples include the NEWINC incubator and the Rhyzome organization. 

-> NEWINC Musuem incubator - an incubator for people working at the intersection of art, design, and technology

-> Rhyzome – an organization dedicated to promoting digital art and culture through commissions, exhibitions, scholarship and digital preservation
