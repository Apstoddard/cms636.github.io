**The Chartjunk Debate**###
In this article, Few highlighted the long lasting debate on chartjunk between two camps of scholars--plain graph supporters represented by Tufte and visual embelishment embracers represented by Holmes--and tried to reconcile the opposing situation between the two sides by re-examining an existing research on the effect of visual embelishment on comprehension and memorability of charts.

Few criticized on several shortcomings of the original research including the failure to differentiating various types of embelishment and insufficient samples. He stressed that the graphics used for testing in the research were too specifically tied to Holmes style of well-designed embelishment, rendering the conclusion unconvincing. His arguments appears compelling to me, but he doesn't give more precise demonstrations of what constitutes global visual embelishment graphics though he gives few examples.

He also criticized on the loose definition of chartjunk defined by Tuftes and posed his own definition. Generally speaking, Few advocates to proper employment of graphic embelishment in terms of better engaging readers' attention and memory to a degree of not distracting or mispresenting from the information.
