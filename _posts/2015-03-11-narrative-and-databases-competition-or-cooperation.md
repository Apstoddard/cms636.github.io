In “The Database,” Lev Manovich explores the relationship between the database and the narrative as ways to represent our culture.

One thing that makes this such an important debate is that the form in which we represent our culture shapes the way we understand it. If we use the narrative as our primary model for the world, that facilitates an understanding of the world as a story of characters progressing over time through a series of connected events.  If, however, we use the database to model the world, we imply that the world is rather a collection of separate items, or data, of equal significance that we can group together in many ways. Just as our vocabulary limits the complexity of our own thoughts, the method we choose to model the world limits the types of questions we ask and explore. If I had to model this phenomenon using math concepts, I’d way that the world is like a higher-dimensional space, and we need to project it into lower dimensions to understand it. Narratives and databases are like two different projections that reduce the world into different lower-dimensional spaces. Each only reveals part of the overall complexity, because neither can store all the information. This is also similar to Manovich’s observation that computer programming reduces the world into data structures and algorithms.

Manovich wrote this in 2001, but already he was seeing the shift from narrative to database. It’s interesting how he points out that narrative was the dominant form of the 20th century due to the prevalence of cinema, but with the 21st century we have seen a shift to the database due to how ubiquitous computers and the Internet have become. If the model we use limits our understanding, this implies that the way we understand our world is shifting from a linear, story-driven model to a distributed, data-driven model. Given the prominence of Big Data, I’d say that this observation is more-or-less correct.

Perhaps even more interesting than the ways in which narrative and database conflict are Manovich’s thoughts on how they can work together. He presents the idea that “a database can support narrative”. A narrative is a particular trajectory through a database. The catch is, not all trajectories through a database constitute narratives; they must satisfy some particular requirements of a narrative. For example, in film, the editor may be tempted to use a variety of special effects out of the database of all possible effects. But using too many without thinking will result in a work that is just a _list_, not a _narrative_. The key is that it must be done with purpose. I think the narrative would be better defined as a _purposeful_ trajectory through a database. The best artists, like Vertov, are able to use this idea of purposefully traversing a database “to seduce us into his way of seeing and thinking.” Narratives and databases are both powerful tools for understanding culture, and being able to use them cooperatively, rather than in competition, opens up new possibilities for cultural exploration.
