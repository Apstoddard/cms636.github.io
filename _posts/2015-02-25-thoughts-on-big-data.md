As the title suggested, I found the article fairly provocative. As a Computer Scientist, I have a certain affinity for Big Data, and at first I found myself getting a bit defensive against some of the claims this article is making. However, I realized that this is the point of the article; to get the reader to think critically about the methods of Big Data to ensure that data is used in responsible and appropriate contexts.

A common problem to using data is the assumption that data will give you only truth and facts, which is addressed in the second section of the article ("Claims to Objectivity and Accuracy are Misleading"). One point that the authors bring up is that the data itself may be error-prone. And if you start from error-prone data, no matter how much of it you have, you'll end up with incorrect conclusions. I think a bigger problem is the assumption that data will result in an objective answer. This reminds me of a similar issue with journalism that occurred a lot when photography was becoming more prominent. There was the assumption that you could tell an objective story through photography because photographs just capture raw data from the world in the form of light entering a camera. This data appears less subjective than the words written by a journalist, but that ignores the entire subjective process that went into capturing the photo. A photographer chooses what to take a photo of, how to frame the photo, what to leave out of the photo, how to post-process the photo, and how to present the photo within a carefully curated collection. Big Data is the same. A researcher chooses which data to look at, which data _not_ to look at, what methods to use to process the data, and how to present the results. These interpretive steps are inherently subjective, so any claims about the objectivity of data need to take this into account.

Another section that I found interesting is the section titled "Bigger Data are Not Always Better Data", particularly when it discusses the value of "Small Data" at the end of the section. I'm taking a class about entrepreneurship, where we've recently been discussing the merits of doing market research to learn about the needs of your customers before designing a product. We talked about two main methods of doing so. The first is "quantitative" and the second is "qualitative." Quantitative research usually involves sending out a survey to a large number of customers to try to find trends and patterns in the data. However, it is often more productive to to qualitative research, which means meeting one-on-one with a smaller number of customers and conducting personal interviews. You can usually gain more important insights by closely observing individuals. However, both are valid methods and in conjunction will probably result in better results than either alone. This seems to be the same with Big Data and Small Data.
