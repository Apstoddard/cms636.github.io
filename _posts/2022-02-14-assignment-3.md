### The Experience Economy

Although interesting, I find that this text remains unfortunately too superficial and loses a lot in trying to remain general enough to address all possible types of experience. There are two reasons for this: first of all, maybe the concepts mentioned were far from obvious at the time the text was written and with our present eyes it is difficult to fully appreciate them. Then, approaching the experience from a purely economic point of view greatly restricts the field of consideration that can interest practitioners. By trying to position oneself between the academic and practical communities, the message becomes confused. While making a difference between experience and entertainment is relevant, the conclusion drawn through the concept of engagement also seems to me to be limited. In the context of the museum, I noted the idea of engaging all the senses and the abrupt transitions between various environments unified under a single theme. 

### First-Time And Repeat Visitors: What Makes A Satisfying Museum Experience?

I think the trade-off between analysis and recommendations is nicely done in the text. The section on literature review (especially the Visitor Satisfaction part) most often consists of stating a point and its opposite in the next sentence, which is quite unsatisfying for the reader. I'm curious if this type of analysis is now routinely conducted in most museums or if it remains an exception. I also agree that comparing multiple types of museums is also important for gathering relevant information about target customers. Finally, the challenge of leveraging this information dynamically and frequently to adaptively converge on an optimal experience seems to be an open and interesting question.
