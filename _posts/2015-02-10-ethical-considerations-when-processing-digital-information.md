Consuming massive amounts of digital material brings up fascinating ethical considerations. Consider the example given from the text: a database of holocaust
survivor testimonies. In the past, close reading was a feasible option and it allowed for total dedication to the subject material but for such a large dataset
it is actually impossible to give equal time and thought to every sample. In some ways this is ironic because it dehumanizes the holocaust survivors, but the
data is still extremely valuable and needs to be analyzed somehow (in the most ethical way). I think this is the kind of problem that digital humanities can solve through some clever programming and data representation.
