I liked how the ICA digital guide is first and foremost very intuitive and simple to use. 
Simone Leigh's video is captivating, and the resolution of the artwork presented is excellent. Along with the labels, the ease of exploring and viewing the items in the exhibition is an important feature. 

I also liked the "Design Your Art Wall" concept and the prompts provided in that section. They have the ability to elicit thoughts. It feels similar to visual thinking stratigies:
"What do you notice right away? How does it make you feel? What does it make you think of? How would you describe it to someone?"

The quality of the objects on the app is much better than the quality of the objects at other museums on their website. This makes me think that along with the labels, the prompts, and the videos how is the experience different in person as opposed to using the app and who is the audience the app targets?Â
