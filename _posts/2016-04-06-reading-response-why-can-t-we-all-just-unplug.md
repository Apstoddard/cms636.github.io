title: "Reading response: Why can't we all just unplug?"
---

As someone who _hates_ having conversations over text and can't stand it when the person I'm talking to whips out their phone mid-conversation and cringes watching people at an event spend more time posing for selfies for their new profile pictures than talking to other people or having a good time, the article by Turkle was like music to my ears. I like the idea of trying to have more "sacred" spaces or times that are meant to be device-free, but I do wonder how realistic this is to impose as technologuy develops and how quickly we will find ourselves in a world where no one is ever unplugged. 

In some situations, I find that having my phone out during a conversation facilitates it: with my family, we are always talking about movies and using our iPhones to find out more details or interesting tidbits to discuss with each other. These kinds of interactions make me think twice about being so cynical about technology, but deep down, I don't think I'll ever get over all the points Turkle makes about our flight from conversation.
