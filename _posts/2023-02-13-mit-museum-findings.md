What attracts your attention?
-	Moving things, unusual things that I haven’t seen before. Large things. Things that quickly grabs my attention/I have to know what’s going on quickly or else I lost interest and get distracted by something more shiny. 
What’s cool?
-	The way the museum incorporates the different senses with their various exhibits is very fun. Lots of things to do/things to interact with
-	Huge collection right outside the classroom 
What’s unusual
-	Some exhibits were hard for me to understand. They were just kind of there, and I couldn’t seem to find relevant information either
-	I couldn’t find descriptions about a lot of the huge collection outside the classroom? I didn’t understand why they were there or what they were.
-	Malfunctioning Jibo
-	I left the typing brain analysis exhibit very confused because it gave me no conclusion about my brain.
What’s confusing
-	Sometimes it was hard for me to find more information on the exhibits
-	Sometimes I didn’t know how to interact with some exhibits and/or what the purpose was
-	Hard to figure out the bigger picture- is there one?
Things to think about when designing
-	Who are the types of people going to the museum? What are they looking for? 
  o	Collectors
  o	People looking for inspiration
  o	Instagrammers 
  o	Social experience 
  o	Learners, etc. 
-	Is there a way to design an exhibit to catch someone’s attention and maintain it for a long period of time? 
-	What should be the social culture of the museum, and how do we facilitate that? 
-	Screens showing videos with in-depth detail on exhibit- can we reset them so people can watch it from the beginning? It’s really bothering to not be able to start from the start and not know when it ends
-	Think of better ways to enhance the experience using technology rather than just screens. 
-	Perhaps design an experience that feels rewarding after users work for it? (This is in relation to the typing exercise- I felt very disappointed for not getting  brain analysis afterwards)
-	QR codes- can we make them pretty/ a part of the exhibit, like in the tunnels?
