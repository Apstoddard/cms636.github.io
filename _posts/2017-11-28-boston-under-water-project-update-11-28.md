After prototyping visuals in Sketch and interaction flows in Flinto + Keynote, we've moved on to actually creating our web prototype, which currently is just an implementation of scroll controls for placeholder imagery + the first iteration of our text narrative. The text moves to seamlessly match the user's location within the narrative of changing images. In our next prototype, these images will be switched by a video of changing typographic maps that we'll have created.

This first iteration acts as a proof-of-concept for the technology we are implementing as we're still developing our own textual narrative, typographic maps, and more details to enrich the information we plan to showcase.
