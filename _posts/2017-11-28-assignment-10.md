Ernest discussed different ways of digitally archiving information and the rise of mathematics in aiding this process. One method he discusses is "on-demand" and while I agree with him that it's useful for archiving what is most needed first, that may result in the loss of "hidden treasures" or valuable material that isn't very well known and therefore isn't "on-demand." This method may also bias archiving towards the will of those who have most control and not an actual archive or representation of information.
I also thought Ernest's discussion of whether the value of archives lies in the actual information being preserved or the media through which they are preserved was interesting. I think that information is the most valuable currency in this case but some level of preservation of the actual media is also important to preserve the emotions associated with the information
