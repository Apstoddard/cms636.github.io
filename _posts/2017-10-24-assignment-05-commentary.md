**The Chartjunk Debate**

Key Arguments:

1. Graphical embellishments can represent information redundantly in useful way.
2. Nothing that supports the chart’s message in a meaningful way is junk.
3. Graphical embellishments support the effectiveness of a data visualization in engaging the interest of the reader, drawing the reader’s attention to particular items and making the message more memorable.

I sometimes have the feeling that when visualizing the data through diagram drawing, no matter how reasonable the diagram I draw seems to me, it’s just my subjective thoughts. How can I know whether the audience can receive the information I try hard to express when presenting this to them? How can I make sure they grasp the same idea and feeling behind the drawing despite of their different experience and backgrounds with me? How can I balance between junk information and suitable decoration to attract people’s attention at their first glance but not to make them overwhelmed with redundant information. I don’t think there exists any rule or principle to guide any artist or designer on what graphical embellishment can support the effectiveness of a data visualization. But the principle is for sure that anything that does not deliver the message is considered to be chart junk.
