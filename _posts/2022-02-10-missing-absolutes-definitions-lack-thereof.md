## notes on Enhanced Critical Curation - Anne Burdick

My main takeaway is that much like most of our ongoing discussions, our definitions of curation/curator/collections have changed over time. I often hear discussion of how the rapid change in technology has influenced our social/personal lives, but never in my day-to-day life have I thought about its effect on museums. 

Perhaps an important feature is that our definitions of these things will change over time--both due to funding or role in society or changes in perceptions--and it's its own task to be on the pulse of these changing factors to avoid obsolescence. 

Curation, too, has become more accessible to "everyday people." With online collections of movie/media sites such as Vudu or instagram, we can play curator within our own right--something that may not have been a concept beyond what someone might keep in their own room.
