title: "CFRP Prototype: Interactive Ticket Sales Graphs"
category: updates
author: Val Healy
---

a) I would like to make an interactive set of graphs. Example graphs could show daily/yearly/quarterly total ticket sales in a line/bar graph or ticket types and amounts in consolidated bar graphs. Notable events (political, economic, cultural) would be displayed with markers on the graphs, and one could reach an individual document (and its transcription) by clicking through the graphs. The transcriptions could also be searchable.

   b) The photos could be stored on my site or on their original site. The graphs and transcriptions would be stored on my website. I would put a search bar on the side, as well as a link to the directory of the transcriptions. The main page, however, would feature an interactive graph, with buttons to change time segment and graph type.

   c) I know only a bit of code, so I am unsure what tools I need. I suppose I could create the website in HTML and use some sort of data visualization software for the graphs.

   d) My intended audience is scholars and other people who are interested in French culture, history, and commerce.

   e) My project seeks to provide answers to questions of how commerce at this theatre has changed over time, situating its fluxes in sales in its historical, economic, political, and cultural context.
