1. Do you think dialogue with in-person scammers would depict the same underlying story as the scam emails you have compiled? What kind of character is the typical scammer/ is there a common voice?

2. What was the "turning point" that led you to start further analyzing scam emails rather than just collecting them?

3. From your work, how do you think "trust and the internet" has evolved so far? Where do you think internet scams will go in the future?
