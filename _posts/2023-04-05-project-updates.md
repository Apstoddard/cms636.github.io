## Project Update

Outreach:
- Debbie Douglas: We've made contact and she has indicated that it is likely that MIT Musuem would be interested in hosting this in an exhibit. We're in the process of scheduling with the relevant decision makers
- MOMA connection: We reached out to some friends to someone who works in the donation office at MOMA, and she speculated that our project could be useful for quantifying stastics for donors who are focused on objectives and using this as a tool to raise more money.

Technical:
We've acquired needed equipment and successfully run a model on images online that counts people in a room, our first objective. Next step is connecting the cameras and locating a dataset to meet the objectives of the musuem 

We also looked into methods for performing analytics that allow museums to better understand visitors' preferences. We will use the following information to characterize a particular piece of work:
1. Content: we will use the machine learning model CLIP, a multimodal model that combines knowledge of English-language concepts with semantic knowledge of images, to generate text descriptions of the artworks given the images
2. Theme: this will be determined from the curators' descriptions
3. Other metadata: artist name, year, medium, etc...
