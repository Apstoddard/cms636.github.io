The Republic of Letters was an international correspondence network including many of the Enlightenment's major intellectual figures. The [Stanford Humanities Center](http://shc.stanford.edu/digital-humanities) compiled data from this huge set of exchanges and, through an extensive series of [case studies](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/casestudies/index.html), crafted visualizations to illuminate the movements and relationships behind them.
