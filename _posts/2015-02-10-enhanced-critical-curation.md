The development of the web has made curations simultaneously easier and much more difficult. While the web allows for quick linking between a variety of media sources, as the shear volume of media increases, critical curation becomes more difficult.

Critical curation is the process by which media (traditionally texts, but now expanded to all digital forms) is organized and displayed to best convey the information to its readers. The reference to compression and decompressing is most intriguing and demonstrates a flaw in web research. The situation often arises that in attempting to understand or familiarize one's self with a topic, information overload, the presence of extraneous details, and the forgetting the concepts previously covered occur. In this case, the web's "world at your fingertips" mantra becomes a daunting obstacle, rather than a helpful aid. Students can get bogged down by the shear volume of information, and not retain much of the information that they find.

As digital humanities progresses, effort should be place in attempting to better curate the knowledge surrounding humanities topics such that the are easily conveyed to the general public. While increasing information will make this task difficult, information is not useful if it is not convey in a meaningful way.

*As a side note, while not a humanities project, a research project I heard of was attempting to create a chrome extension which could keep track of concepts googled (in this case about math) and link them in a meaningful way in a side bar, so as to allow the student to quickly look at what they had already seen and relate it to concepts discover later. This type of application seems to do a kind of on the fly curation.
