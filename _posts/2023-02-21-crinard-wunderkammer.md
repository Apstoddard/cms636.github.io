## Wunderkammer: Travel

Travel is a thing that I see as wonderful, that is to say that it is something that I personally enjoy greatly. Unfortunately, it's rather hard to do during the semester, so I've put together a set of items that remind me of it in my room. These are items exhibits that represent travel in an intrinsic way to me, and I hope you enjoy them. 

### Item 1: Model Airport
I put together a scale mock-up of what the sort of arport that you might be able t oget anywhere from might look like, and I've attached an image here. (I've been doing this since high school, so the exact layout may change).

### Item 2: Backpack
I've taken my backpack with me pretty much every place that I've traveled, and through some remarkable engineering (and good care/repairs) it's survived.

### Item 3: Aviation Headsets
Over the pandemic, I spent a fair amount of time flying around the U.S. in small aircraft. These are the headsets and kneeboard that I used.

### Item 4: Watch
I've always travelled with a watch, it's incredibly useful.

### Item 5: Duct Tape
Whenever going to places that you haven't been before, things often go wrong. Sometimes it's the tent leaking, other times a piece of equipment doesn't work quite right, still others clothes rip. I used this roll (back when it was in it's prime) to patch all these and more.
