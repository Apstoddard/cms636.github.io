### Alien Reading: Text Mining, Language Standardization, and the Humanities

In this article, Binder introduced LDA,a useful tool applying text mining technology for topic finding and stated the fact that LDA performed perticularly better when it was fed with scientific texts. The possible reason for this phenomenon, according to Binder is that the vocabularies of scientific texts correlate with their topics in a more uniform fashion than that of a poem or a prose, which accords with his argument that "there's a congruity between text mining and the language standardization efforts", both of these methods "tend to reinforce the 'literal' conceptions of language and meaning and marginalize the nonstandard linguistic conventions and modes of expression".
