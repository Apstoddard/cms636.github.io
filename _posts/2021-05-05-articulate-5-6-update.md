## Research

## UI/UX 
We've edited our wireframes to take the feedback we've received into consideration. 
Here's a [link](https://www.figma.com/proto/qWZ8ITvQK8M2P9pIW4IeyA/ARticulate?node-id=9%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1) to the updated mobile prototype. A data policy (wording is tentative) has been added to the begin page, so that we can be upfront to the user about how their data is used. Because having to login might dissuade users, we've moved the login page from right after opening the app to after the user indicates they want to respond to a piece of artwork. That way, users can still view others' responses without having to login. Kristen told us that regarding demographics, the MFA is interested in people of underrepresented races/ethnicities and sexual orientations. We're not quite sure how to ask people for that information within our app, or if our app should even be the place to ask for this. Since asking for demographic information might be offputting in general, we've temporarily removed it from our UX. 
Here's a [link](https://www.figma.com/file/PQIldnDWa6Jhb0wUKj2K4H/ARticulate-web-app?node-id=0%3A1) to the updated web app. The only noticeable design change is adding name/date to the AR annotations, so that it's clear in the ARticulation gallery that adjacent annotations and responses may not be related.
