title: Updates for Final Project

After talking to everyone in class, David and I thought that we had similar topics and themes because we were both interested in visualizing changes in data over time from popular sites like Reddit and Github. Keeley's was similar as well in that we all wanted to see how certain trends come and go, whether they are on the internet or in print. Specifically regarding my original idea of visualizing the internet over time through Reddit, I realize that I should narrow down the scope of the project so that I don't try to bite off too much at once. Besides looking at the top subreddits for every month and their corresponding metadata, we could also focus on just one topic or subreddit such as science or AMAs. It would also be interesting to explore the differences between media sites such as Reddit, NYTimes, Facebook, etc. to see how information flows through different sources or if there is an inherent bias in certain sources.
