Hello! My name is Parker Greene and I'm currently a senior at MIT majoring in computer science with a concentration in CMS. I have a strong interest in computer graphics, and this past summer I worked for Pixar on the rendering team for the movie "Coco". In addition to animation and movies, I'm also interested in video games and virtual reality.
