This is the generation of Big Data. With the increase in technology, we are making more observations, more data than ever. And one of the most significant progresses is in social media; we can start to quantify human behaviors, and this has enable us to make some quite surprising discoveries about our own society. 

However, whenever we do human-related research, there always comes a question of ethics and representation. Are these results true, or simply a misinterpretation? And this article by Danah Boyd and Kate Crawford discusses the "Six Provocations for Big Data" that we should consider whenever we do Big Data research.

Two of the more interesting provocations I thought were that "Bigger Data are Not Always Better Data" and "Just Because it is Accessible Doesn't Make it Ethical". 

It's easy to think that the more numbers we have the more "objective" we must be becoming. While general patterns may emerge, it's not necessarily representative, maybe simply because human behavior are not usually observable and based heavily on the context. For example, if we were to download all Facebook statuses, that's billions and billions of data, but is it representative of human behavior? We might conclude that those who post the most statuses must be the most active - but is that true? Not at all. Personally, I barely post statuses but I check my News Feed almost every 15 minutes, and among my social circle, I'm definitely one of the more glued-to-social-media type, but analyzing my activity online would indicate completely otherwise. And in this example, we see that social media is merely another channel of expression, and how we utilize it differs per person, and we must take that into account were we to analyze it.

Another provocation is that access is not equivalent to acceptable. Just because the data is out there doesn't make it ethical to download it all. Yes, when I post my profile picture to Facebook, I understand that there's a risk that some creep might steal my picture, but overall, if someone does steal it, chances are I will say something, that the picture doesn't belong to him/her. Similarly, just because I participate in social media doesn't mean I consent to being monitored, although I know I may very well be. The fact that my data is open to public doesn't make it acceptable to simply download them and use them as you please.
