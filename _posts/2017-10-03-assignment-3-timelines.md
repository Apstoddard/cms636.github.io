Drucker emphasized in her article was that most visualizations oversimplify ambiguity. Given that this dataset represented a contentious topic, I wanted to create something that gave a sense of volume of events that were occurring simultaneously. One thing I was worried about was doing anything that might project a false sense of objectivity, which is one of the reasons why I tried keeping things simple. However, if I was more proficient with software/design tools, I would have liked to have sorted the events by type and source.
