AI has always seemed to be a popular topic of interest for people of all ages. Younger audiences are fascinated by the idea of communiciating with something that is not considered human while older ones find AI useful in simplifying various tasks. However, the author makes a good point of how we should be cautious of how the ever changing technologies affect our lives as we could become too reliant on it. While AI can be very beneficial, if it is something the museum heavily relies on, the museum could lose its original purpose, especially if something happens to go wrong with the AI or it is not inclusive of people of various backgrounds.
