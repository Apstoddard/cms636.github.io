I find it interesting how curators have now become responsible for the organization, condensation, prioritization, and presentation of data nowadays. Sometimes I've wondered when I search things online- though it feels like the topic I'm searching up has a lot of information on it, the sites that I end up getting into all seem to contain the same limited amount of info. Data, in a sense, has become "useless" or "lost" because of its sheer amount, and the data that comes to the surface is what people choose to be important and relevant. 

I wonder how curators can take responsibility for this (and what they want to take responsibility for) when it comes to data/info and its presentation/meaning?
