The article gave good insight on sound data use; I find it really interesting how sound data can be used and interpreted. A lot has to do with sight and sound--I wonder, can other senses be incorporated? Smell and sound? Taste and sound? I have no idea how that might work, or if it could, but the prospect seems interesting. Maybe someone might be able to take the smell of a fruit bowl and turn it into music. Or generate smells based on music--perhaps to scent a dance floor, or some other atmospheric augmentation.

There was this really cool project at a hackathon I attended related to sonification--a team tried to turn companies' performance in terms of stocks and economic development into a song. There were really nice tunes that came of it. I was really impressed how such a type of data could become such wonderful sound. There are really cool ways to turn data into sound that isn't even originally related to sound. Then, there's also the other way around: someone at MIT made a dress last year that lights up in response to sound, designed for a dance floor.
