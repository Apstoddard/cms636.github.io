title: Questions for Francesca Torello- Devin
---
-What was some of the feedback your students got about their exhibits from the public? 
-Did you run into any problems with the Google Tango platform you used? Did you find that it fit the purposes of your application good enough? Were there things you wished it had or were different about it?
-Was the entire plaster connection compatible with this app? If not, how did you choose which pieces to incorporate into your app?
