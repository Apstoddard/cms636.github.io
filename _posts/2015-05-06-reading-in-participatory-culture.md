I found it quite interesting that four out of the five media literacies are social. My development of traditional media skills were also social: constantly trading papers to draft with high school classmates and editing other’s papers. We were supporting each other and encouraging new perspectives. I believe that schools in teaching us to be effective consumers, we learn to consume, criticize, and absorb a lot. Much can come from the reinterpretation of consumed content. There is no need to be completely innovative or attempt to reinvent the wheel. There are important universal concepts that classic literature can bring into a student’s life. Wrestling with traditional literature in a traditional consuming way allows students to make interesting connections and encourages you to acknowledge, analyze, value, or criticize what already exists. 

I would love to see students of new media literacy use their skills not only for traditional literature or new media literature, but a mix of both. Integrating digital humanities into communities could could be an innovative, constructivist way of learning and practicing new media literacy and active participation.This would also encourage critical and creative engagement of texts, which overlap with my interests in innovating library spaces. Following transmedia navigation is a very open space for libraries to explore. It allows students to incorporate infinitely many combinations of personal, social, creative, critical/consumer media literacy. 

I wish we could have read more about new media literacy in low-tech environments. Concepts of civic/democratic literacy could prove incredibly interesting in those spaces. Without the spacelessness of the web, new media returns to the core importance of communicating with other physical beings in physical spaces.
