- My attention was caught when Howard Greenberg mentioned his collections were never really about "scholarship", but were moreso "from the heart". As a curator, what is it like to play this fine balance between curating collections that might just speak to an artist, while also having to put together collections that might educate audiences or match the goals of the institution?
- I am also interested in the ideas you talked about regarding the democratization of photography. I would love to know what you think of Hito Steyerl's views from her "In Defense of the Poor Image", where she says, "The poor image has been uploaded, downloaded, shared, reformatted, and reedited. It transforms quality into accessibility." Where do you stand on the spectrum of quality and accessibility, especially where the poor image might be pirated/illegal, but in turn more accessible to more people?
