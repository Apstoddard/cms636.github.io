## Critical Curation

Having lived only in a generation of information overload and digitization, I found this topic of curation versus collection an interesting aspect to explore. Part of this comes from exhibitions, which can only meaningfully display a number of objects, and one key information overload comes from photography and photos. 

I am curious about the factors that come when choosing photographs (or more generally or visual 2D objects) to display: does only choosing the ones in best condition defeat the idea of historical authenticity? What about in terms of sharing the context behind the photo? The intent of the photographer- as an art form, for publicity, for social justice. And what does a "personal photo" when created for oneself such as a portrait or just ones we have in our phones now, serve to outsiders years later?
