The interactive AI in museums mentioned in the Styx article are really interesting. It mentioned Recognition, a matching game of recent photojournalism and art and how this was used both inside the museum and virtually. This seems like a really great way for museums to get visitors to engage with pieces that aren’t currently on display and while visitors are at home. I’m wondering how this looked inside of the museum - would the AI suggest similar pieces, and then if pieces were in the museum’s collection, it could show where in the museum it was? There is opportunity here for AI to be used as a way to get visitors to further engage with the museum as opposed to just being a game.

In the computer history article, I found it interesting that the developers wanted to have users be able to choose between human or machine generated metadata, or a mix. Is this for ethical or security or for comparing the results? Why would they go through the trouble of developing this technology just to also do the work themselves?  

This article also brought up using the machine learning services to provide textual descriptions of images for visually impaired people. How could this best be used in the physical museum context beyond a purely digital platform for virtual images? There’s a lot of room to explore here, maybe having an app that scans the work and reads out the description, though this seems as though it would only work in the context of art museums.
