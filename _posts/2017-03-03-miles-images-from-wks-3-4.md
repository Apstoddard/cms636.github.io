_Time Mapper_

**Pros**
- Scrolling, moving forward and back, clicking on new items: all very intuitive
- Duration of events highlighted in bottom bar, allowing user to quickly see other event-points occurring within a different event-span

**Cons**
- Vertical organization of events in timeline conveys no information: missed opportunity
- Size of tabs with event titles in timeline have no relation to event duration
- No visual indicator of relative information: for example, "Iran hands over 16 captured al-Qaeda fighters to the Saudis" is dated June 1 - June 30, 2002, but the act is not confirmed until August. There should be some way to note who had the information when. 

_Proposed Alternative Design_

- Gradient boxes refer to specific durations
- Green, yellow, orange, and red colors indicate relative levels of peace or hostility implied or initiated by a given event
- Events originating in the US, Iran, or elsewhere are indicated in different rows
- Events recognized at different times in different places are indicated with stars and arrows
- Icons associated with certain events are included next to the title at the top of the page to clarify color and placement information in the timeline
