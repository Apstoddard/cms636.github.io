Hi! I’m Michelle - I’m a senior at Wellesley College majoring in Media Arts and Sciences, an interdisciplinary major between computer science + art. My current interest lies in wearable tech, specifically innovating ways to merge physical + digital components to create seamless experiences. I’m currently working as an interaction design intern part-time at Bose and as a TA for a Human Computer Interactions course back at Wellesley.
