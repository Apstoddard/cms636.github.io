**THE ANIMATED ARCHIVE**

The digital Humanities offers new challenges and possibilities for institution of memory that archivists, librarians and curators can not simply enlarge but completely re-envision their communities, publics, and missions. The memory palaces will be bigger both from the standpoint of the physical territory and the corpora of information they harbor.



**HUMANITIES GAMING**

Although being considered by many humanities as frivolous, digital gaming demonstrates a capacity that could transform digital humanities pedagogy. The main reasons are two fold. The first is that game-world simulations are capable of functioning in real time with multiple participants no matter where they are.  The second is that the audience nowadays is a generation of students who have grown up gaming. How to take the gamesmanship of humanities research as the basis for games of scholarship is the challenge this method faces.
