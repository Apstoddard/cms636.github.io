- A working title
CoCurate - Reclaiming the museum experience 
- A description of the issue/problem that you are trying to address 
Most museums today offer perspectives, critiques and histories around art pieces that have been curated by a small team of experts. I propose developing an open platform that allows artists, academics and musuem visitors to contribute to the conversation through short voice memos. Think of it as the OpenStreetMaps for art. Imagine visiting a musuem and having the power to access thousands of short recorded clips with perspectives from all over the world for one art piece. As a musuem goer, one will also have the opportunity to record their own clips to be shared with everyone else. I envision an enriched musuem experience for everyone where perspectives, critiques and histories are discussed, challenged and debated online. Making the musuem visit a lot more than just listening to pre-recorded and heavily curated content from the museum only. I am interested in further exploring the idea by adding NFCs / geolocation as a potential technology to enhance museum integration into the platform. 
- The envisioned audience for your project
>All museum goers, this can be implemented without the participation of the museum 
>Art critics / writers / artists that are excited and willing to share their knowledge and perspectives with musuem goers 
- Potential museum collaborators (currently MFA, MIT-Museum, Getty, Carnegie Mellon, Computer History Museum, and others are possible as well); 
MiT museum seems to me the most logical entity for such a project due to their experience with audio 
- The technological approach (if part of the project) 
>Prototyping the platform on Figma 
>Exploring geolocation for tracking 
>Exploring NFCs as a potential integration mechanism into museums 
- Skill sets needed for your project 
>User research 
>Visual design 
>Understanding of NFCs / electrical engineering
