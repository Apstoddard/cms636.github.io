Aron Qiu is a sophomore student at MIT studying architecture and finance. His past experience in the relevant fields include architectural design, graphic illustrations across different media, art installation, as well as data processing. He previously worked as a design researcher at MIT Media Lab: Fluid Interfaces Group where his team partnered with Snapchat on a soundscapes project that focused on transforming vocalization & ephemeral sounds to tangible artifacts through AR/VR features in Lens Studio.
