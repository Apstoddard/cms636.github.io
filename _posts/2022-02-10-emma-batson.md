Emma is a PhD student at MIT in electrical engineering studying new materials for superconducting electronics. She is interested in the ways scientists can better engage with their communities and share their work in an accessible, educational way for everyone. When not thinking about science, she reads too much, drinks too much tea, and experiments with watercolor paintings of various plants she takes pictures of during walks around Cambridge.
