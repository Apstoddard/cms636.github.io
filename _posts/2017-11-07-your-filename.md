After going through the whole collection of the images, we decided to focus on the facade of buildings to give the audience a direct impression of how the facades evolve through time.

Step1:Picking out all the pictures related to building facade, this was done in Excel using search and filter functions.Isolate the selected metadata into a new CSV file.

Step2:Register the Omeka account and install import CSV plugin. The plugin is convenient importing the CSV file and seperate the columes. There are some inherent tags/elements that can be matched to the metadata.

Step3: Upload corresponding images into the collection.

Step4: Edit the appearance.

The tool is generally easy to use, and has some flexibilities for customization, for example, adding customized element to the columes, editing multiple items at the same time etc.A minor flaw is that after an item is uploaded, you cannot preview it on the very same page.
