It occured to me upon reading this article, that I am totally one of those people who prefer to just read the signs next to exhibits and then quickly move on. Occasionally, I'll "pull the lever" as they say in the reading, and interact with the more "do your own experiment" installations (for example, the Newton's gravity laws ball drop at the Museum of Science). But in general, if things seem like too much work, or that I have to really shift mental gears from "being in a museum mode" to something else (for example, pulling out an app for a specific display, or something of that sort), I don't really like to do it. I think that I wouldn't mind participatory opportunities that some other students talked about with museums handing out iPads or the apps on phones that had to do with Roundware. 

I like the ideas of the book and pin drops as a form of feedback for libraries and museums. It is simple, effective, and doesn't take much thought or effort on the part of the visitor. I also agreed with the reading's take on the definition of participation. One shouldn't have to make something in order to be considered "participating". I think that criticism and spectatorship are both very vaild forms of contributing to an experience, particularly in online spaces. It would be overwhelming if everyone on YouTube added videos, but I enjoy that YouTube videos often have hundreds or thousands of comments and likes/dislikes. These ideas remind me of Tumblr, which is sort of a curation site of sorts. People tag things on Tumblr â€” these can be original posts or "reblogged" posts, but each time the post is shared, users can re-tag them, recurating and arranging the content. There are aspects of creation, criticism, collectors, and spectatorship on the platform.
