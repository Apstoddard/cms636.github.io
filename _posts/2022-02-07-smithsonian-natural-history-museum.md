## Online Presence of the Smithsonian Natural History Museum

The Smithsonian Natural History Museum's website largely succeeds at presenting the museum as an attractive place to visit, offering a number of resources aimed at different audiences, and engaging with different communities. The website, aesthetically speaking, is pleasant to look at and fairly easy to navigate -- nothing terribly slow to load or otherwise off-putting, though some UI choices are odd (like the collapsible menu that, by default, covers a considerable portion of text on most pages until manually closed). Under the section on "Exhibits" you can find information about all of the permanent and temporary exhibits currently open. These segments seem intended to get potential visitors excited about the exhibits. Each contains three subsections: "Look for," which describes the highlights to be seen at the exhibit; "Things to Do," which describes interactive elements of the exhibit; and "Experience More," which suggests two more exhibits that appeal to similar interests.

The museum website also provides a number of resources for educational or research purposes. They show information about their collections, which are separated by department and fully searchable. Information can be mass-exported as a CSV, with a photo of the object and metadata about its name and origin. Additionally, researchers can visit the collections, schedule time on analysis instrumentation, and even borrow objects. For teachers, the museum provides subject guides and toolkits for hands-on class activities. There are also several webinar series aimed at different audiences, including late elementary school children, families, Spanish language speakers, and adults. Transcripts are provided for the videos, making them more accessible. Overall, it seems like a fairly typical/traditional set of resources for a museum to provide, but a very thorough one. Taken altogether, these resources seek to address the needs of researchers, students, teachers, and the general public.
