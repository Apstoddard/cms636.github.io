  I think Camila's Sharing Emotions and Xiaoyi's Play with Art could be interesting to tie into the blending audio aspect of my proposal, where you share a small clip of a song and people can listen to the range of audios that people imagine fits with the piece when you walk up close to the painting.
  
  Emma's Audio Library could also fit well with having a tangible and interactive way to create your own narratives using others' audio clips but in a larger physical space, and Devin's Cultural Continuity Project could be a great interactive story that people who live(d) in EC or other closed dorm groups to continue adding to the dynamic preservation of the dorm culture.
