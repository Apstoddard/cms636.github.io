Ahmed Elgammal is a professor at the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University. He is the founder and director of the Art and Artificial In						
Marian Mazzone currently works at the Department of Art & Architectural History, College of Charleston. Marian does research in computational art & computer science applications to and art history.

They applied machine learning in visual analysis, conducted visual correlation research through fine-tuning several convolutional neural networks. As Art historians identify, characterize, and define styles through visual interpretability of physical work with their cultural and historical consistency, there is no definitive evidence of the formation and change of styles.	   
The research trained and tested with 77 thousand digitized paintings into 20 style classes, adapting variants of object categorization models AlexNet [10], VGGNet [11], ResNet [12]. What they got is pretty amazing, illuminating the computability of what seems to be a subjective issue.

Their findings manifest in the following aspects:
- The research indicates the existence of small amount of factors that encapsulate the characterization of different styles;
- They trace a smooth temporal transition between styles, I felt even visualized the temporal dimension, how styles are 					
- They Studied the activation manifolds learnt by machine, unveiled interesting connections in the history of art in a quantifiable way: Impressionism and Cubism-Abstract , renaissance and modern styles
- Prominent artists sit at the extreme points of each style dimension, Amazing, not only peopleâ€™s choice, calculation, concrete evidence
- Bias toward subject matter related feature.	The research used color 	,they have the ability to learn whatever features suitable to discriminate between styles, which might include composi- tional features, contrast between light and dark, color composition, color contrast, detailed brush strokes, subject matter related concepts 
- highlight the potential application that data science and machine learning, in the domain of art history by approaching art history as a predictive science to discover fundamental patterns and trends not necessarily apparent to the individual human eye.
