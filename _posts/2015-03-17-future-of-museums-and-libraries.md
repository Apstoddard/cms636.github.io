Though I've not been to many museums, I've always enjoyed visiting museums whenever I had a chance to. The experience of seeing physical objects in real life is irreplaceable. The subtlety of colors in the paintings and the texture of objects are far more visible in a museum than in the digital space. The museums allow people who normally would not have any access to famous art works to view them close up. The museums definitely hold vital roles in providing people exposure to important art works from both present day and from the history. I think the roles of museums and libraries didn't change much in the 21st century though they are no longer the sole source for people. The digital age definitely makes art and books more accessible in a different format. Though museums also allow people to share their ideas and transfer information, the digital world definitely makes it easier for people do that. 

I don't think libraries are as important as museums in the 21st century. Visiting the museums provides an experience that cannot be replaced by other format but visiting the libraries is not as unique. It is far easier to access information digitally for research and other work than going to the library to browse the books there. Even the rare occassions that I chose to go to the library, I often used the online platform to find the specific book location first and went straight to the books I wanted.

Although libraries and museums both face difficulties and chanllenges in the 21st century, I think they are indeed facing different problems. Museums have an advantage at providing irreplacable exprience while libraries can hardly provide any experience that people can't get elsewhere.
