1. Photographs are inherently personal. When was the last time you were stopped in your tracks by a collection? What are elements of a photograph that speak to you? 

2. Along the same lines, is there a difference between photography that speaks to you and what you perceive speaks to the general public?

3. As a human, I am sure you are drawn to specific background photographers/time period/composition of photo. How do you mitigate your unconcious bias towards a specific genre of photography? How collaborative is your position as a curator?
