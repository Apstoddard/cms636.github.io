Wajid and Minott’s chapter was moving. They seriously profiled social injustices and ways for meaningful museum change while still maintaining a humanizing perspective. I was especially moved by the story of the 2 women meeting the father with a newborn baby in the conclusion.

The topic that stuck out the most to me was the ripple effect from the activist museum exhibit. The museum exhibit should spark change beyond the physical exhibit halls. And what is the best way for a museum to spark real change? I think that museums are a lot of people’s first introduction to a new culture or history. The authors talked about “familiar stories told from unfamiliar perspectives.” I think that the visitors’ reactions to controversial exhibits generate the best insights to people’s attitudes towards activist topics. I am curious - what are ways we can leverage museum spaces to collect visitors’ thoughts on controversial topics and find common ground for facilitating perspective-shifting conversations?
