title: Additional Email Scam Representation Ideas
---


After reviewing the scam emails and using the Stanford Name Recognizer, I noticed that a lot of the emails attempt to associate themselves with a location, whether it is a nation such as Russia or an organization, such as the United Nations.

Therefore, I think a good representation would be to show a map of the world with dots representing countries, such as Nigeria, and organizations, such as the United Nations. When a user clicks on this dot, it can take them to a floor with animated characters that tell their story when clicked on.

I also noticed that a repeating theme was that of a victim with cancer.

This gave me the idea of exploring the relationship between storyline and promised reward. In this presentation, the user can read through scam messages where the promised sum of money has been blanked out. The user can then guess what amount of money was being promised, and they are scored according to how close they were able to get to the true sum. This would be an interesting way to test whether larger sums correlate with more dramatic stories.
