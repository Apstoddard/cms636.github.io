For someone whose parent or friend was victimized by scammers, how do you think your art and exploration of related themes help them gain new insights?

If traditionally scam artists would be face to face with the people they were victimizing, does the distance and anonymity of the internet change the sort of people who use scams to prey on individuals? Do societal ethics change - is it "less bad" to bilk a single person intentionally than to participate in unsafe schemes with some uncertainty, that end up bilking hundreds of thousands of people?

Are there any "spam" movements that are aimed at helping the unsophisticated survive and protect themselves against predation - any creative, artistic movements to make things better?
