Over break, I visited the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and subsequently analyzed the ethnography of the museum as a public space.  I do the think the masses would benefit if MoMA incorporated new technologies into the exhibits and spaces to make a more  ‘data dense’, particularly in respect to exhibits displaying more traditional art forms (i.e. painting and sculptures).  However, there is a distinction between enhancing a physical environment through augmented space, and creating an environment that is entirely data dense.  I think the former is acceptable and often times helpful, while the latter presents an atmosphere that can be overwhelming and over-stimulating.  

Throughout the text, Lev Manovich referred to Times Square as data dense, augmented space.  Though Manovich does not necessarily believe that Times Square utilizes the potential of technology and informational displays, it is, nonetheless, one of the more readily available heuristics when describing the concept of an augmented space.  I have never found Time Square to be an enjoyable atmosphere, and the constant barrage of images, advertisements, and information is exhausting. While Manovich did describe other augmented spaces, such as the fluid space designed by Venturi, that initially seem new and exciting, I think actually inhabiting a space that itself is malleable and constantly changing does not sound pleasant, but rather would quickly becoming disorienting and wearing. 

Another issue that remained unresolved in Manovich’s essay was that of the monitoring that accompanies augmented spaces.  If the idea of augmented space were to become more pervasive, I think there could be real issues and breaches of privacy.  However, the pros and cons of continuous monitoring were glazed over, and not fully realized or developed.
