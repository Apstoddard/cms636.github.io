title: The Potential of Spatial Humanities
author: Kelly Huang

The text summarizes the history of GIS and the utilization of spatial mapping in humanitites, highlighting limits of the tool. I think it's interesting to think of physical as well as metaphorical, social or cultural spaces at the same time. While they are quite different in nature, they definitely interact with each other, and it is meaningful that they are both called "spaces". I find the conclusion very intriguing, with the vision of reimagining mapping and spatial knowledge, though it seems challenging and abstract, which might make it less likely for scholars to invest time and energy to develop it thoroughly.
