Shayna is a sophomore at MIT studying a DIY mechanical engineering curriculum (Course 2A) with a minor in Science, Technology, and Society.  They are working on a variety of things, including the MIT Minecraft Project, documentation about MIT dorm structures and Greek life, trying new hobbies, building a pulley system between the two towers of McCormick Hall, and babying their dorm room 3D printer affectionately referred to as "homeboy".
