### Presentation

### Problem Statement
How have different ethnic cuisines mixed in NYC, in terms of neighborhood, price, and reputation?

### Pitch
New York City has always been known for its wide variety of ethnic ciusines. There are about 24000 restaurants in NYC, each of them providing unique insights into the area it operates in. Restaurants, cafes and bistros can tell us a lot about the culture, lifestyle and community of the area. Our idea is to build a web application that would let users explore the restaurants in NYC and see the data map overlaid with other interesting statistics about the city's various areas. In addition to that, the application would allow the user to generate a food tour in NYC. It would be customizable by length, popularity, cost and other factors, and generate a journey that would let users experience the various cultures of NYC through the food they have to offer.
