## Notes on 2040: Hello, and welcome to the future - Adam Rozen text

This piece struck me as an extremely optimistic piece discussing the question of our current state of museums/galleries/exhibit/third spaces, while simultaneously bringing forth the question "what makes a museum a museum?" When examining the inherent purpose of a museum and who it's for, and trying to broaden that, I think it becomes inescapable to have to think what differentiates a museum from an educational facility, a library, a photo opportunity (in our current age of social media!) etc. Maybe there is no differentiation and maybe there shouldn't be--I don't have a fully fleshed out opinion on this, honestly.

When we consider this article in the context of museums as holistic experiences, I think it well-documents the necessary shifts museums have had to undergo (or perish!). Growing up, I often thought of museums as places to _look_ at stuff--be it historical recreations, art, scientific exhibits. However, when I began to revisit certain locations as an adult, I noted a shift towards hands-on and physicality and the idea of being a part of an exhibit. 

One thing I think I would  have liked to read some discussion/documentation of is the move of museums into completely immersive concepts; i.e., exhibits in which there is actually no meaning, movement, ideology, etc without the viewer there (of course, this can arguably be all exhibits). What I mean specifically is locations such as the [WNDR Museum](https://www.wndrmuseum.com/),[City Museum](https://www.citymuseum.org/) or even [Omega Mart.](https://www.omegamart.com/) These museums have a dedicated "play"/**YOU are the exhibit** component. These certainly encapsulate the idea of a holistic museum experience, but I wonder the extent to which it can be applied to all museums? Just how much participation can or even _should_ every museum have will likely differ based on type (science? history? art?). As a museum exhibit changes toward experiential, how does that change its purpose or role?

Rozen notes this seems to follow the lead that libraries have played in engaging with their communities. I do think this is interesting as libraries do often play an important role in many communities. 

## Notes on At the Foot Of The Hill 
This article documents the choice, process and experience of the Lascaux International Centre for Cave Art. An immensely interesting concept, it treats a museum as an experience and a part of a shifted landscape; as opposed to an attempt to change or replace something that already existed, it sought to become a part of it. It's an extremely dedicated version of exhibits that cast/replicate certain locations. I really enjoy the idea that the original pieces be left where they are and simply built into displays as opposed to the removal and taking of them. 

I think one inherent question I have is the longevity of such a museum, however. To me, it seems one concept it is hinged upon is the dichotomy of "ancient cave technology/art" vs "modern architecture/art." While interesting, I think that our modern landscape of constant, quick updates could render the "experience" outdated. This may not be a problem, I suppose.

Overall, I do think this museum was quite an impressive concept overall and seems to have succeeded in its purpose of both preserving these cave paintings while allowing the general public to experience them as well. One is immersed into the experience of being in a cave, as archeologists and the original cave painters were.
