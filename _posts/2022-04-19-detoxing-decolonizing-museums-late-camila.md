Wajid and Minott's chapter delved into the racism that exists in the systems that govern the museum space, and the methods used to decolonize those museums. The chapter discusses different methods and people that are involved with activism, but one of the most intriguing groups of people that Wajid and Minott touched upon were the people in the digital space that stimulate conversations. The conversations that are happening in the digital space work as a catalyst to drive forward the attempts to detox museums. Therefore, it made me think about how museums can create more platforms that stimulate and accelerate those conversations.
