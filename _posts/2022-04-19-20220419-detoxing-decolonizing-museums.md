### "Detoxing and Decolonizing Museums," _S. Wajid, R. Minott_
  
  A larger concept that was touched on but that I didn't fully acknowledge until now is the fact that museums and their workings do not occur in a vaccuum. The way that items & concepts are displayed & discussed within these institutions directly impacts the way that the audience interprets & internalizes the content and how they take this information out into the world. It is important to have both internal and external agents of change when it comes to the deconstruction of institutionalized colonization, and as stated a balance has to struck between the norms of the institution and the push for change as to not fully destabilize the institution. However,
  > The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change.

  How much change can truly be brought about when having to consider multiple factors in the prosperity of the original museum as it has stood? How can we fundamentally change established institutions without fully disrupting the current power structures? Do we even want to fundamentally change these structures or is the point then, in striking the described balance, to change the way that people think within these structures?
