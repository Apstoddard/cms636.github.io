## Mini Project
I used Fusion Tables since I've worked with CartoDB before, and here's what I made!

### Tooltips
First, I added a simple tooltip that displays a table of information, as guided by the instructions.
![Map with Tooltip]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img1.png)

Next, I overlayed an image (with sli![img2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img2.png)
ghtly lower opacity than instructed), to show the datapoints in line with the old map!
![Map with Image Overlay]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img2.png)

While FusionTables is nice and easy to use, other mapping tools such as Carto are more modern and flexible. In particular, they take a more database-centric approach rather than focusing on CSV files or spreadsheets.
