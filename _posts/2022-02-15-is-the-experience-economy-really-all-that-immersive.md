### The Experience Economy

I approached this piece with a fair degree of skepticism, as I found the attitude that the "experience economy" would fit all entertainment options today, including museums, to be a little overfitting and general. However, as I continued reading, I wanted to challenge the notion that quote-on-quote immersive experiences lead to memorable events. I believe the idea of "information overload" in today's digital era challenges the notion that all well-designed experiences leave positive impressions in our mind. For example, iPhones and our smartphones today are extremely immersive, not only do you absorb and spectate on phones anymore, but also have the ability to become an active participant in apps/social media. However, because of the sheeer quantity of information, no matter how involved you might be, I'd argue we are not left with a longlasting impression for the large majority of the content we "involve" ourselves in. I wonder how information overload might eventually transition off the digital screen and into everyday activities if we continue with this obsession to create everything into a marketable, enriching experience that requires user participation. I believe its fundamentally disruptive to many experiences that are better left with arbitrary purposes other than to entertain, such as museums or other introspective experiences.
