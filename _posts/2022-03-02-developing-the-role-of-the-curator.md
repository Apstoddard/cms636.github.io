I found it kind of refreshing, after all the discussion of how a participatory museum philosophy could benefit visitors, to examine how it might affect curators. Moreover, I was glad to hear that working on participatory exhibits could indeed be beneficial to curators too -- certainly increased collaboration within the museum as well as a deeper connection to visitors sounds healthy.

I was honestly surprised about the hesitation expressed about simple things like having seating in exhibitions -- that seems like an incredibly straightforward quality-of-life improvement, and obviously useful for accessibility. It was weird to see that framed as "experimental." Also, the idea that there is a tension between a museum's reputation and its attempts to serve its visitors' needs is, while probably true, kind of concerning. Why should there be a tension there? Should everything in an art museum appeal to the aesthetics of a select group of people?
