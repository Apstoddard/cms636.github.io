**Is the hyper reading and machine reading everything to digital reading?**
​
Hyper reading and machine reading are definitely digital savvy compare to close reading. However, it is definitely not the only reading solution in the digital era. 
Hyper reading gives structures to the text, preventing too much information loaded in one page. Also, it is a way to respond to F shape reading habit. Besides, interactive element is added into the equation. Hopefully, it might increase the interest level of readers. One of the biggest problem for hyper reading is that too much engagement is required. When readers don’t have the motivation to click the hyperlink, this reading method is not useful at all. 
​
As for the machine reading, it is more concentrate on text analysis rather than meaning. For example, users can easily figure out the word frequency and its comparison by using some machine reading tools. However, it is a challenge task for the tools to understand the text and do further analysis for users. With the progress achieved in natural language processing, I believe more intelligent tool would come into being someday.
