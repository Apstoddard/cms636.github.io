What really stuck out to me in this reading was the discussion of disorder, scarcity, and seeming randomness in written timelines. When I first saw the timeline on page 12, I admit I wrote it off as badly written and difficult to follow. When I read the reasoning behind these sparse, disjoint events--a collective reflection of the chaotic and disorderly times--I understood the importance of these annals in addition to the ones that tell more classic narratives. I think that this disorderly, random quality of the world is still present now--maybe just less so than it used to be.  

With this thought, I couldn't help but think of a parallel to movies. Indpendently produced films (often known as Indie films) can usually be distinguished from mainstream movies because their narratives feel raw and unpolished--more realistic. The films are usually comprised of two types of scenes: those meant to move the story along and those meant to give life to the story by depicting random bits of everyday life that are often left out when recounting a story. These films are less enjoyable to people who like  narratives to be polished, tweaked, even engineered to create the most compelling or thrilling story--like they often are in mainstream movies. I am not an Indie film fanatic, but I do appreciate them. Thinking of annals as the Indie films of the timeline world made me appreciate them more.
