I'm also interested in something related to language which is influenced by the fact that my father is from Nigeria and speaks Igbo, but never taught me or my siblings. The language is dying because many people are choosing to use English instead, and the lanugage has stopped evolving an lack often lacks words modern day concepts. One of the ideas I had is something would help to examine how a language changes over time, particularly a dying language that isn't evolving to include modern vernacular. I imagine all the words in a language written out with a slider at the the botton allowoing one to select a year. The current words in the chosen language would be written out in one color, while those for which there isn't a translation or the word is taken directly from another language would be different colors, or perhaps move elsewhere on the page.
