Lev Manovich explores the differences in database and narratives in “The Database”. Manovich claims that new media has "no beginning or end" and that they "do no have any development". He also views database and narratives to be on two ends of the spectrum. However, they are in many ways related and most likely cannot be separated. 

Database consists of mostly elements that can be used to organize different kinds of information. Database allow us to manage the information we have in the world in a more systematic and better-formatted way. Although numbers and data are not the most intuitive ways to tell a story, they can often provide very interesting narratives. Therefore, it would make more sense to view database and narratives as two complimentary formats. 

Manovich mentioned in the ariticle that web pages provide elements that are in the same database. It is true that this is different from a traditional narrative. However, websites consist of stories, movies, and other forms of media is basically a collection of narratives. They are stored in a database format but the elements themselves are in fact narratives. I think this is analogous to libraries that organize book which are narratives using a more traditional database.
