Lev Manovich explores the differences in database and narratives in “The Database”. Manovich claims that new media has "no beginning or end" and that they "do no have any development". He also views database and narratives to be on two ends of the spectrum. However, they are in many ways related and most likely cannot be separated. 

Database consists of mostly elements that can be used to organize different kinds of information. Database allow us to manage the information we have in the world in a more systematic and better-formatted way. Although numbers and data are not the most intuitive ways to tell a story, they can often provide very interesting narratives. Therefore, it would make more sense to view database and narratives as two complimentary formats. 

Manovich mentioned in the ariticle that web pages provide elements that are in the same database. It is true that this is different from a traditional narrative. However, websites consist of stories, movies, and other forms of media is basically a collection of narratives. They are stored in a database format but the elements themselves are in fact narratives. I think this is analogous to libraries that organize book which are narratives using a more traditional database. 

The data and algorithms section doesn't seem qutie applicable to today's technology. AI of computer games has improved drastically in the past 10-15 years and it is quite likely that players will not be able to predict exactly what the outcome of the computer model is. Also, games are putting a huge amount of attention to the narratives and the visual effects to make it more enjoyable and engaging. I don't agree that video games are simply just the algorithms. People play games to enjoy the story and the experience which in fact focus more on narratives. 

Overall, I don't think narratives and database are at the two ends of the spectrum. I think they are very closely related and cannot be separated. Though digital formats created new media forms, the narrative nature of these creations is still very important.
