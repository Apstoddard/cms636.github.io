Manovich remarks how narrative and database are “natural enemies”, and much of his text illustrates how the web tends to favor the database approach. What is intriguing, however, is when Manovich says “Competing to make meaning out of the world, database and narrative produce endless hybrids”. It is interesting to note that even as databases become commonplace, the narrative can still be found within them.

Take this website, for example. It is a database of posts. We can search, navigate, and view posts. There is no linear order and little cause-and-effect between posts. However, within each post, we have a narrative. This post, for instance, is a narrative about the symbiosis between narrative and database. There is a clear order within the post and there are links between concepts.

I wonder if the narrative-database hybrid is more common than pure narrative and pure database. As I think through digital examples, I’m struck by how many of them are hybrids. For example, YouTube is a database of videos, but each video is a narrative. Medium is a database of blogs, but post is a narrative. Facebook is a database of users, but each user’s timeline is a narrative of their life. Database and narrative coexist in many forms.

I was also surprised by how we have transformed database into narrative, and vice versa, even within this class. After learning about RAW, we worked with the CFRP (a database) and tried to use visualization to tell a data story (a kind of narrative). Last week, we saw how taking Moby Dick (a narrative) and looking for references to places can yield a database of locations.

While database and narrative are opposite ideas, we should remember that they need not exist indepently. Instead, we should learn how to use them together, or as Manovich puts it,  “merge database and narrative into a new form”.
