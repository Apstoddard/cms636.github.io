## Summary

There is a lot of overlap/tension between education and exhibition, the "real" and the attainable, the seeing and the experiencing of architecture. We see in these projects the way cultural notions of authenticity or dedication to a canon can actually impede learning, and sometimes an unconventional strategy which rejects these notions is what actually brings an experience to more people, as with plaster casts, Plaster ReCast, and the College of Fine Arts building itself. Replication, in particular, has long been a mainstay of architectural education, as buildings cannot be moved around for exhibition. It's interesting to think how modern technology can aid this tradition.


## Questions

- You talk about the stigma around plaster casts as "fakes" -- generally what do you think about replicas and authenticity vs accessibility? Also, do you have a favorite example of "architectural deceit?"
- Plaster ReCast reminds me also of the fact that marbles were mostly originally colored with really vibrant paints. Do you think AR could be useful for highlighting that, or other "forgotten facts" about these kinds of objects?
- It seems like a lot of what's interesting about the College of Fine Arts building is the particular history and even the life experience/perspective of its architect. Is it possible to convey that to visitors in this non-museum setting? What are the challenges/opportunities in that?
- There's a lot of overlap between history and art, but they're usually positioned as totally separate kinds of museums or disciplines. How do you think about trying to combine them?
