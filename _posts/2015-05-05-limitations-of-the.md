The aspect of this paper that really struck me was when the authors were explaining flaws in our current education system. Clinton, Jenkins et al, correctly identified that our current school system, where we sit in classrooms and do what we’re told, can only provably develop our skills of doing what we’re told. For the most part, we don’t provide our educators any real indication of having learned the lesson or theme. This peculiarity actually reminds me of a time my friend wrote a flawed machine learning algorithm. He was trying to identify cars in an image and every his system correctly identified every car in every image except for when he gave it an image of a wheelbarrow. The algorithm identified the wheelbarrow as a car because, even though he thought he was training his system on cars, he was actually just training it to identify wheels. This is part of the reason why the NML got together in order to develop the TSG. In some ways, the TSG has been trying to fix this problem by redefining but I think it’s still clinging on to dilapidated concepts.

Sometimes things just have to die. The TSG and the NML seem overly focused  on perceived irrelevant things like Moby Dick. I don’t quite understand the holy crusade that’s happening in order to save that book from the depths of history. If Moby Dick needs to be “given new meaning” by educators shouldn’t that just be an indication that it needs to die? Sure, the story itself may re-occur for every new generation but why does every new incarnation of the same story need to be so shackled to the original one? It would be pretty simple to include a small forward explaining how “X Modern Story” is another timeless reincarnation of Melville’s classic Moby Dick. In this way, the inclined reader can simply refer to Moby Dick, she doesn’t have to experience a painful and convoluted “re-interpretation” which seems to be the norm these days.
