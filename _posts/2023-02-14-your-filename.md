## Enhanced Critical Curation

I found the message that the information overload of the modern world enhances and emphasizes the need for a curator to be very powerful. In addition to the fact that they need to spend more time sorting the giant sets of data to find what is truly valuable, the digitization of the world makes it even more challenging to sort through multimedia collections. The curators who are taking on this task are essentially the visitorâ€™s filter, looking for the best way to present a story around an item in the vast collection of information and knowledge.

While finishing up this reading, I remembered a video I watched a while back that explained how more than 90% of specimens in the Smithsonian is in storage rooms. The knowledge resonated with the realization that curators in this day and age have a lot of choices when it comes to designing and choosing the different pieces for an exhibition. How and what they choose can have a huge impact on the experience of the museum as a whole, as most visitors do not have the chance to see the entire collection.
