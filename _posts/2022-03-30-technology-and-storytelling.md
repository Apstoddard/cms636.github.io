I really agree that technology should always be part of the solution to the question of how to best present content, rather than trying to shoehorn content to justify the use of technology. It's also an interesting point that people's expectations have changed: we can get information anywhere, all the time. Museums must be present in online spaces, but they also have to provide things we can't get there -- whatever the tangible parts of "experience" are, I guess. Maybe beyond experience, there's still also the act of curation -- not so much museums as an authority, per se, but certainly museums as a more surefire way of finding actually interesting content than infinitely scrolling.

Since our project will probably be sort of an open space concept, the labyrinth, while kind of fascinating, is probably not a technique we'll explicitly use. However, storyboarding could be crucial -- it will be important to think about different paths people could take through the stations and make sure they're likely to stumble upon a compelling narrative regardless of their exact choices.

An interesting aside is that both these articles specifically called out medieval churches for their early use of architecture as storytelling. Having been in a few, there's definitely something pretty special about those spaces, that genuinely you don't see anywhere else.
