## _The Enemy_

I went into the _The Enemy_ with hesitations, and left with the same skepticism towards VR, especially in an arts context. Some immediate pros and cons: To set the right expectations, I believe naming conventions surrounding VR / AR should focus on film terminology such as "screening" rather "experience" which is rather vague. It also puts the user in a mindset to wait in line, enter at a single time, and remain for the entire time. That said, a timed experience is a good way to keep the visitor in the space for 15 minutes to watch every soundbite and see every image. This does mean that if there are technical difficulties, everyone's "experience" will be pushed back. This was true for mine, and we were running 30–45 minutes behind and a couple people left. Upon entering, I was disappointed by the skeuomorphism. Why use a gallery/theater motif? This seemed like a missed opportunity to have a more transportive experience. The content itself could have easily been a white cube exhibition. When characters beyond the frame first appeared, it felt surprising and finally met the initial expectation, but the interview format soon felt templated. However the eye contact and gesticulations from the characters were good cues for when we should come and go. I also couldn't help but think of the sanitation issues — were they wiping these goggles down before and after each screening? Was the Occulus Rift a product of sexist engineering? Overall, I think a lot of work needs to be done for a successful VR experience to occur. 

## _Transforming the Art Museum Experience_

This text left me with several questions: 
- Is gamifying the “engagement” a reductive approach? 
- Let’s question the engagement we actually want. If it’s to pose and share, the visitor's investment in the work might be as fleeting as the prompt.
- Were there examples of technology that is invisible until you need it? Maybe iBeacons or push notifications?
- In the comments, people are curious about how to implement this on a smaller scale. Is it exclusive? What are the affordable options?
- These interfaces are expensive and timely; how can you consider visitor engagement 2 years from now when these look outdated?
- Do the examples shown praise the technology rather than the art?
