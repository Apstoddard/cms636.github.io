I think it’s good to acknowledge, as Anna Baccaglini does, the pros of discursive knowledge. I do think written and verbal displays can  allow visitors to analyze, interpret and reflect upon objects and information, and sometimes its nice to leave that work to the visitor, and as a visitor its nice to have that work left to you and see what conclusions you can draw. 

I thought it was interesting when she talked about museum visitors forming personal relationships with objects through touching them, as she points out this is something that is often not possible in a museum because of its simultaneous goal of preserving collections. It also seems that Baccaglini takes the stance that museums will probably need to compromise on the preserving collections side of things, rather than the other way around, again exemplifying this shift in museum purpose. 

I thought the Archeology of the Netherlands exhibit of handling real hand axes was interesting, and reminded me of our discussion of the physics objects at the MIT Museum. There’s something about using the original object-not a copy of it- that contributes to a more personal connection. It seems the hard part about designing these kinds of exhibits is thinking about what objects in a collection can withstand types of repeated touch, or how tactile relationships with more delicate objects be facilitated by other means.
