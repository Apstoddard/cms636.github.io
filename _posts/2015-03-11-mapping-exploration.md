For this exercise, I wanted to situate the novel Moby Dick by Herman Melville in the time period in which it was published. To do this, I decided to try to overlay my GIS map of locations mentioned in the novel on a world map I found of exploration and discovery routes. The novel was published in 1851, so I chose a map from 1850.

Here is the result:



As you can see, routes through the sea were still being established during that time. It seems incredible, then, that Melville would have even known of all of the places mentioned in the book. 

Unfortunately, the map itself is a bit blurry. I feel that the quality of the visualization would improve if I could find a higher-quality map. Furthermore, it would be neat to have another GIS overlay highlighting the ship routes to make them more clear to the viewer.
