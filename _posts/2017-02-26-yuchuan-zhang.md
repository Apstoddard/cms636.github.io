Yuchuan is a first year urban design student in Harvard Graduate School of Design. She is interested in data visulization and how to select appropriate tools to select, interpret and present data to the public. Her background of both architecture and urban design study provides her with the strong ability for graphic drawing. She would like to try more tools on the related fields like programming in helping visualizing data.
