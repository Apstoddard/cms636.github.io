The article gave great overview about augmented space and augmented reality. First, it introduced the concept and idea about augmented space, and used a lot of real project to demonstrate what we can do with this new concept. However, as far as I’m concerned, insights are lacked in the article that it failed to discover the revolutionary possibilities of augmented space. In other word, he failed to answer the question raised by himself:

“What is the phenomenal experience of being in a new augmented space? What can be the new cultural applications of new computer and network enabled augmented spaces? What are possible poetics and aesthetics of an augmented space? “

First, the technology mentioned in the article is not cutting-edge and I understand that it is because this article is written in 2002. The technology that could be used in augmented space has changed drastically. Second, he seems like confined himself into thinking that it is an architectural problem. Most of the examples he gave is the project done by architects. At my perspective, architect always view technology as a tool rather than the subject. Architects sometimes would emphasis too much on the philosophy they want to present and some opportunities might be neglected. Cases and thinking from all disciplinary should be taken into consideration. Also, Lev is paying too much attention on physical surfaces and I do think augmented space do not necessarily rely on the physical surfaces(walls). Third, the other senses such as hearing and touch seem like missing here. (except for Janet Cardiff case) I would like to address that all the senses are indispensable in augmented spaces. Forth, the interaction element is totally missing in the article, which is the phenomenal difference between augmented space and physical space. Technology enables the motion of space to react and incorporate human’s motion. 

Last but not the least, I would like to share a project which is not a traditional augmented space project – “[Soundaffects](http://www.tellart.com/project/soundaffects-nyc/ "Soundaffects")”

It changes the way how you perceive the city, the built environment, light, temperature, and weather by using the sound elements of space. Our experience largely depends on what we see. However, I always thought other perceptions is crucial as well, maybe way more important than we thought.
