After reading the articles, I went the the VR exhibition.

Personally, I think Gallery One and the Enemy share common merits in many aspects as follows:

1.The enemy and Gallery One both take good advantage of blending art and technology. Visitors are closely engaged in the visiting tour. Their feelings and understandings of art will be deepened by technology interfaces. It also reminds me of another exhibition about Giorgio de Chirico. At the end of the tour, visitors will be introduced to wear VR equipment to actually be in of one of his paintings named Mystery and Melancholy of a Street. I totally immersed in the space and felt a strong feeling of restless and tension although I could only felt little when standing in front of the 2D painting.![de695130b77e49289f11c1eaf4c26c3c_th.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/de695130b77e49289f11c1eaf4c26c3c_th.jpg)


2. Some of screens in Gallery One offer interpretation and digital investigation of the art to tell a sound story. While each room in the Enemy tells a story composed of two opponents standing face to face. 

3. They are not only imposing visitors information and data, but also allowing visitors to respond back their own answers. In the case of Gallery One, visitors are engaged with the art on view through questions and experiences. As for the Enemy, our experience is customized. In the final section, based on the amount of time I had spent “interacting” with each fighter, I walk towards a mirror and see myself as one of the fighters, who mirrors my own motions.

4. The two exhibitions both make visitors feel empowered to browse, explore, and create personal meanings about the museum’s collection. In Gallery One, visitors can walk through the galleries with CMA’s director to discover his favorites, or they can follow a theme that carves a focused path through the museum’s galleries. While in the case the Enemy, before I entered the exhibit, I was asked to take a survey that would determine the sequence of how the characters appear. I was told even the lighting in the virtual museum is determined by the survey answers and contributes to the interactive journalism.

5. They are applied to multiple platforms. Each of them has well developed apps on iOS platform to be more influential. 


And beyond that, the Enemy itself has more strong identities. By giving visitors the opportunity to meet soldiers from opposite sides of the same conflict and hear their personal perspectives on war face to face, the Enemy is really a valuable tool for building empathy and provoking discussion.

As mentioned in The Poetics of Augmented Space, artists should take an advantage to experiment with the identity of a gallery: from a traditional space of aesthetic contemplation to a place for play, performance, lectures. By doing so, a huge difference will be made. I really appreciate how detailed their work is in the Enemy. For example, While on location, as I moved , the soldiers would move precisely and always faced towards me, looking at me with eyes that say so much.

My only question is that according to Lev Manovich, we need to approach the design of augmented space as an architectural problem. But when I was in the virtual rooms, I barely noticed special design of the space. But this actually compelled me to be more concentrated on the the contents of the space: what soldiers were talking about and how they moved. So is it really necessary to give too much emphasis on architecture design when approaching the design of augmented space?
