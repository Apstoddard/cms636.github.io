Outdoor spaces on museum grounds can be important places for people to socialize and enjoy the atmosphere of the museum, but their artistic value can go underappreciated compared to the indoor galleries. For my project Iâ€™d propose a scavenger-hunt like experience where museum goers are given images taken from different parts of the museum grounds. When the user finds the area pictured, they can unlock audio or videos of members of the museum talking about how it was created or acquired for the museum. The goal would be to introduce visitors to parts of the museum they may otherwise overlook, and highlight the artistic value of aspects of the museum outside the gallery walls. This was envisioned with the Getty Center gardens in mind, but could easily be adapted to other museums. For easy accessibility, a web-based app would likely be the approach for the project.
