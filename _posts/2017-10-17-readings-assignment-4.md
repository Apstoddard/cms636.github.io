## The Potential of Spatial Humanities

The argument which criticized GIS & positivism resonated and reminded me about Churchill's (quite overused, sorry) quote that “history is written by the victors.” While history textbooks and historical information is taught and treated as fact, it always speaks the story of the oppressor/winner/power of the time while either silencing or erasing the other side of the story. This ties into Bodenhamer’s argument that GIS reflected the “influence of money and power” in its official representations of the world. 

Still, it is important to have some kind of standard system like GIS, even if it might be flawed. It allows logical analyses of a breadth of data. It was even inspiring to read about the potential that GIS has for creating explorative interactive representations and to “create virtual worlds embodying what we know about time and place.” I looked at how GIS + VR are being used today, and learned that the  city of Zurich uses a program called CityEngine to create scenes based on existing GIS data to compare urban planning scenarios for sustainable building, which seems like a really useful application of these technologies.
