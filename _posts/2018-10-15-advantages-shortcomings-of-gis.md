I agree with Bodenhamer that GIS has limitations when it is trying to represent abstract concepts such as time and blurring information. However, most of the problems of GIS Bodenhamer mentioned has been or could be resolved. For instance, advancing technologies could make GIS less expensive and cumbersome, and better UIUX design would enable humanists to learn the tool faster and less painful. I believe that the advantages of GIS is that it can visualize text-based information, and make it easier to understand especially for the general public. Moreover, as Bodenhamer states, it shows the relationship between individual pieces such as writing records, video records, and artifacts, so people can always understand them within a larger contexts.
