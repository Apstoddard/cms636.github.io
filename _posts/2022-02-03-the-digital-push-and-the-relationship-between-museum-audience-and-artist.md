## Commentary // 2040: Hello, and Welcome to the Future

I'm interested by the idea of the "Digital Push" and the proliferation of museums that begun to exhibit reproductions of artists' original pieces in "exhibitions the world over". Is there an inherent responsibility for an artist to have their work reach wider audiences? Or vice versa, what is the responsibility of an audience or museum to an artist and their choice of representation? I wonder if changes in the museum as a civic institution over the past 20 years, or "museum culture" as Rozan puts it, has had any emerging impacts on artists' perspectives on their own creation, in the larger scope of things. Especially in the now and into the future, I think it's reasonable that museums prioritize the interests of the audience (especially new, younger audiences) and our ability to access an artists' works, but I believe to some degree this obligates art to "fixate on technology" and the audience, rather than personal creation. While art to an extent is a reflection of the times (or times are a reflection of art), in a world of increasing "digital production" and "fabrication", it almost feels as if all our future's exhibitable art must be compatible to a certain narrative (i.e. the audience's needs) -- almost embodying a to-and-fro conversation between museum and audience, but devoid of the artist's voice.
