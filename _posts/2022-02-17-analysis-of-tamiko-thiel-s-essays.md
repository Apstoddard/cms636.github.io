#### Cyber-Animism And Augmented dreAms

In this text, I greatly appreciated the artist's need to return to the foundation of the concept of augmented reality, and to motivate precisely the need to augment. I found very interesting the inherent need of virtual concepts to exist within a determined, even metaphorical place. First, in the heavens and now in seemingly limitless cyberspace. I think a discussion of the concept of space in progress may be fruitful. I was intrigued by the mention of Facebook and Twitter as simple and very effective technical solutions to enable the creation of a community and a virtual space, at the expense of the more complex 3D construction. The notion of the smartphone as a real revolution and gateway to new media is also interesting in this context.


#### Where Stones Can Speak: Dramatic Encounters in Interactive 3D Virtual Reality*

The text adopts an interesting dialogue about the relationship between real and virtual space. This relationship begins as a competition, where the virtual must equal surpass the real to then lead to a full existence. I appreciate the exploratory side of the artist who borrows from many fields their reading grids (music, video games and architecture among others) in order to methodically proceed to the act of design and analysis. The concept of embodiment seems to be central here for the author and implies to re-invent the narrative process. The clear rejection of an aesthetically beautiful but meaningless virtual world is also a crucial point of the text, a mistake that seems to be commonly made by amateurs in the field. The artist's various works help to illustrate a process of exploration of various new tools or conceptual frameworks. I am very curious to discuss with the class to what extent this designer role is present in a more traditional view of the artist, focusing on the creation of the work more than the experience induced by the work. It also seems to me that there are still barriers to overcome in the involvement of the viewer in virtual reality.
