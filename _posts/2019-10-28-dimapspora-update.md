Since last week, we have made significant progress in identifying sources for data about how many residents speak various languages at home, distinguished by state. This data is available for 1990, 2000, and 2009-2013, which we believe is enough variation in time that interesting patterns can be observed.

For select languages, we plan on providing detailed information about the diaspora of the community that uses the languages in order to give context to the patterns found using our tool and illustrate a way that researchers can use our tool to deepen their research into diasporas. Currently, we identified Tagalog as one of the promising languages for this deeper dive, because there appears to be enough research about Filipino immigrants in the United States that we can incorporate.
