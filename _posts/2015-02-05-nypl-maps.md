The [New York Public Library](http://nypl.org/) has a lot of excellent digitized collections, among them a huge set of maps of New York and other areas. In addition to browsing and search interfaces, they provide an awesome tool called [Map Warper](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/) which lets you overlay historical maps onto a dynamic present-day map. You can check out some hightlights [here](http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/highlights-from-the-20000-maps-made-freely-available-online-by-new-york-public-library/), and view the collection itself at [maps.nypl.org](http://maps.nypl.org/).
