## AMapping Space, Time, and Narrative

****Cleaning Data

Used Melville's trips in London to observe when Melville traveled to certain places throughout his travels. The original dataset contained longitude and latitude points that had commas and ?s in the fields. After ridding the data of unknown coordinates and correcting coordinates that were mistyped, I then added the data to Tableau. 

****Design Thinking

I wanted to map the data out in a way that conveyed a story of Melville's travels over time. After looking at all the points, one could see that his travels were fairly consistent, with most points congregating in one are multiple times.
