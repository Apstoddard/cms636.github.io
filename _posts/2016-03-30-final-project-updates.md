I saw a number of similarities between my project idea about visualizing Github project development and Julia's idea about visualizing Reddit data. Both ideas involve visualizing information that develops over time and being able to easily see the state of the data at any given time. I think the main difference between our two ideas is that Github data would appeal primarily to software developers and Redit data would appeal to a more broad audience.
Through the discussions about my idea last lecture I came up with a number of questions that I would like a Github visualization to be able to answer. These questions are: Does this project look like it will be a success (has it reached a critical point)? How does the development of one open source project compare to the development of another open source project? What are the stages of a projects development?
