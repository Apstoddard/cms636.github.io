General 
Hinges on the idea that there are two extreme roles that curators can take in the musuem, a participatory or expertise-driven one. Catherine proposes that curators take on a visitor’s experience-centric role to curation and expects that this will invigorate the curator’s role. This has an impact on a few aspects: 1.a) defining what do we mean by the visitor’s experience, 1.b) openly refining and updating that definition within the realm of other definitions like aesthetics/beauty/even art? 2) developing new methodologies for curatorial practice; and,  3) accepting that the musuem space has to become more experimental      
(1.a) 
- Why is it important in the first place to think about the visitor’s experience? What is the real aim of such efforts, attracting more people, making the musuem a more pleasant space, enhancing education? 
(1.b) 
- How do we refine and update our definitions of what is aesthetically pleasing/ beautiful/artistic? to create broader social conversations around these concepts themselves.   
Making the leap
- Who is the musuem for? How do we balance aesthetics and our scholarly/peer reputation with visitor needs and engagement? 
(2) 
- There is a focus on curatorial design as a form of collaboration across educators, engagement officers and curators - What are everyone’s thoughts with regards to this perspective in relation to a more open participatory approach which potentially includes the audience themselves and the community? We sort of alluded to this in many class discussions as well. 
New roles, responsibilities and general understandings 
- As curation becomes more collaborative, it suggests a shift in approach from the traditional methodologies and frameworks and into more collaborative design-centered ones. How much should these more traditional approaches be employed in current practices? 
- What does it entail to the structure and roles within a curatorial team? 
Committing to a visitor-centered model 
- In what ways do you believe curators can let the visitor experience with a collection be the center of the efforts? What are some tactical ways this can be done? 
- How do you think this will transform the role of the curator? 
(3) 
Early experimentation 
- Have you seen examples of museums experimenting with new techniques/projects? In what ways did you think such attempts were successful or not?
