- I'm curious to know more about the selection of the sample collection? Was it a panel of members? While the collection had a diversity of gender, race, sexual orientation, etc., was the panel indicative of this diversity, as well? 
- We often learn about the implicit (and even unintentional) bias that exists amongst the average computer engineers (white, male) that decide training samples for ML training models. I'm curious what this discussion might look like at the intersection of art, the museum, and novel technology like machine learning? If anything, do you think there's a difference between the software engineering and museum industry?
- What was/is it like to connect inherently interdisciplinary teams, such as CHM team members and external developers/data scientists (I understand you onboarded a data scientist quite early into the staff)? Was there a natural mutual understanding between the parties at all points throughout the process, or did there ever exist misunderstandings/creases that needed smoothing out?
- How did you balance digesting both internal and external feedback? Was there one group you prioritized more heavily, and how did you make an ultimate judgement based off a large set of differing opinions?
- In general, when designing tools such as these, do you think it's important to have the audience you want to help in mind first? It seems as though the ML transcription tool had a revelation where it could be used to help vision impaired individuals? Should the tool itself or the problem/audience-in-need be fleshed out first?
