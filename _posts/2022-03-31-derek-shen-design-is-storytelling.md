This reading and some of its methods opened up my eyes to the ways we could present our data/written archives for our east-side living project idea. Our group has already spent time debating over the optimal way to engrave the stories into a form that pays homage to its culture and history. I never thought about it, but these texts might very well be forming one bigger picture story that we can try to spatially render. I think navigating between differently themed texts in a 3D walkthrough of East Campus' hallways/rooms, almost in ways similar to the Hero's Journey of IKEA's design, would be a super neat way to represent these entries that might otherwise seem hard to connect together.
