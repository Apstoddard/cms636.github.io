Tracking Artists

##Problem:

Over time, artwork has been scattered in museums and collections across the globe. Because of this, it has become very difficult for people who are passionate about one artist to view their work together. This poses several issues because I feel it is important when studying art, to analyse work over time.  


##Solution:


Moving exhibitions often solve this issue as they are sometimes specifically curated per artist. However, they visit very limited number of places, and often pose a security risk through trasnportation. I want to create an app that collects informationfrom the web about a specific artist and curates artwork, historical facts and news articles chronologically to a person interested in viewing the work. The focus would be on the experience of presenting all material by the same artist viewed on one platform. 
e.g. If I searched Rembrandt, different work would show up and I could view paintings from museums across the world
