## Poetics of Augmented Space, Gallery 1, and The Enemy

Spatial forms can provide people with experience by containing with rich and dynamic multimedia information. We augments the space by overlaying multimedia information onto the physical space. Some of the technologies that allow us to create augmented space is surveillance camera, mobile media, and electronic displays. For instance, surveillance camera extracts data from the space, whereas mobile media and electronic deliver processed data back into the space. 
The main questions of the article include "What is the phenomological experience in a new augmented space? What can be the new cultural applications of new computer- and network-enabled
augmented spaces? What are the possible poetics and aesthetics of an augmented space?"
The author suggests that we think about these questions by approaching the design of augmented space as an architectural problem. Since space not only has a spatial layer of information but also with a virtual layter of data. 
	Janet Cardiff and Daniel Libeskind augmented their space with conventional technology. These examples show that this problem of augmented space is not new to architects. I would argue that that architects and designers have been dealing with this kind of problem for a long time. For example, museums have been augmented their space with more information using "low-tech" equipment such as electronic screens, games, and lightning. Similarly, theaters enhance audience's space by designing the lightning, sounds and stage sets to provide more information than the words of the play themselves in order to hopefully invoke certain emotions and experience.
    Augmented reality is fundamentally not new to people. Augmentation as a concept has been here for a while in different forms. However, with new technologies such as AI, AR, Tangible Interface, and Wearable Computers, some people may perceive augmentation of space as novel or solely confined by these technologies.
        Connection to the Enemy experience
    My experience with the Enemy was a mix of positive and negative experiences.
    Pros:
    The movements of the virtual figures are pretty close to natural human movement. Their movements are seamlessly integrated into the presentation that it was not awkard or distracting. Furthermore, it was a smart idea that there was not much movement to begin with so that would not create issues. 
    Cons: 
    It took me a while to accept the virtual figures as a representation of the real humans. The experience definitely requires suspension of disbelief. After hearing this first person, it was less distracting to listen the other ones since I had fully accepted the characters as real people telling true stories by then.
	The experience was not as interactive or immersing as expected. The audience basically listen to these virtual figures telling their stories. This kind of presentation can be done without the high-tech equipment. The content don't get transformed much through this kind of delivery. However, individuals may gain a new experience through the augmented space that would differ from face-time presentation.
    Gallery One:
    Works on the large scale but questionable when it comes to small-scale museum,
    These new high-tech features can be distracting instead of informative. It might change the mission of the museum.
