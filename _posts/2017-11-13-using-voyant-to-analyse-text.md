title: Using Voyant to Analyse Text

## Analysis of Scientific Paper
Alyssa: I tried using Voyant to analyze a paper I had been reading, "Efficient Behavior of Small World Networks" (https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.198701). I noticed that Voyant had picked up on two separate key words "small" and "world". The paper was about "small-world networks" so in a sense it would have been more appropriate to group together as one key word, howver when I looked at the chart produced of the occurrences of the words over the doucment (below) it becomes clear that "small" and "world" in fact do not always appear together, although they are very correlated. "small" appears more frequently, as it is used in additional contexts such as "small characteristic path lengths". However "world" only appears once without "small" ("we live in a world of networks"), so a smarter text analysis would generate the key words "small-world" and "small"

Kelly: I used Voyant to analyze an English translation of Flammarion's "La Fin du Monde" which I read for my astronomy class earlier this semester. (https://archive.org/stream/omegalastdayswo03flamgoog/omegalastdayswo03flamgoog_djvu.txt) I feel that the tool is definitely helpful for picking out keywords, which are likely central themes of the text, but I'm unsure how else the tool can be utilized. I can also imagine some texts, short stories for example, not having much repetition within them, and most words appear for a small number of times except for conjunctions and pronouns. In this case, the tool might not arrive at any meaningful finding. One feature I find interesting however is the count of recurring phrases; while they are generally fragments that don't convey a complete and coherent idea, they do contain more context and content than keywords, and such a list can be helpful in analyzing writing styles.
