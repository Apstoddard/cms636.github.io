## Analysis of Scientific Paper
I noticed that Voyant had picked up on two separate key words "small" and "world". The paper was about "small-world networks" so in a sense it would have been more appropriate to group together as one key word, howver when I looked at the chart produced of the occurrences of the words over the doucment (below) it becomes clear that "small" and "world" in fact do not always appear together, although they are very correlated. "small" appears more frequently, as it is used in additional contexts such as "small characteristic path lengths". However "world" only appears once without "small" ("we live in a world of networks"), so a smarter text analysis would generate the key words "small-world" and "small"
