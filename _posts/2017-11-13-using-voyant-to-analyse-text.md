title: Using Voyant to Analyse Text

## Analysis of Scientific Paper
Alyssa: I tried using Voyant to analyze a paper I had been reading, "Efficient Behavior of Small World Networks" (https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.198701). I noticed that Voyant had picked up on two separate key words "small" and "world". The paper was about "small-world networks" so in a sense it would have been more appropriate to group together as one key word, howver when I looked at the chart produced of the occurrences of the words over the doucment (below) it becomes clear that "small" and "world" in fact do not always appear together, although they are very correlated. "small" appears more frequently, as it is used in additional contexts such as "small characteristic path lengths". However "world" only appears once without "small" ("we live in a world of networks"), so a smarter text analysis would generate the key words "small-world" and "small"

Habiba:
I liked Alyssa's idea of analyzing a paper, so I also analyzed a paper I've been reading,"Variation in oxytocin receptor density in the nucleus accumbens has differential effects on affiliative behaviors in monogamous and polygamous voles" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768419/). The most common words it picked out were: "voles", "otr", "pairie", "behavior", and "partner." I thought this was a pretty accurate representation because the paper looking at the relationship between increased oxytocin receptor expression (otr) and social bonding in voles. However, they used "partner preference" as a proxy for pair bonding, so I was surprised that "preference didn't show up as one of the most frequent words, although it was in the word cloud, because the word (just from reading the paper) seemed to show up almost exclusively with "partner."

Kelly: I used Voyant to analyze an English translation of Flammarion's "La Fin du Monde" which I read for my astronomy class earlier this semester. (https://archive.org/stream/omegalastdayswo03flamgoog/omegalastdayswo03flamgoog_djvu.txt) I feel that the tool is definitely helpful for picking out keywords, which are likely central themes of the text, but I'm unsure how else the tool can be utilized. I can also imagine some texts, short stories for example, not having much repetition within them, and most words appear for a small number of times except for conjunctions and pronouns. In this case, the tool might not arrive at any meaningful finding. One feature I find interesting however is the count of recurring phrases; while they are generally fragments that don't convey a complete and coherent idea, they do contain more context and content than keywords, and such a list can be helpful in analyzing writing styles.

Tho:
I used Voyant to read my reading assignment but clearly I could not understand what the article was about. I got the keywords but they are too vauge to provide meaning even when they get pieced together. I like the display that shows the keywords of the text. Keywords' size indicates frequency of the words.
