Trudy, Derek, and I have been discussing how we will prototype our final design, as we recognize that having a full projection setup will be difficult to achieve in the amount of time we have left. We hope to have a 3D virtual walkthrough of some sorts, perhaps using the video feature on the polycam application. We can then also potentially add sound to this video, and edit it a bit to show the potential interactions that will be possible in the exhibit. Additionally, we might try to look for some realtime annotation software that will let us annotate over images of murals with an iPad to demonstrate this functionality in our exhibit. Finally, we've been collecting more stories of murals, and will continue to do so over the next few weeks. Our project plans can be seen at this presentation link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ncsZ2a0B1v9b9UUb-ZjsuQGuqkTOGDOv7TmOa4mpwCI/edit?usp=sharing
