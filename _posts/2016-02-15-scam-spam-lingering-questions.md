title: "Scam/Spam: Lingering Questions"
---

Question 1: What do you believe are the "deal-breakers" and "deal-makers" in a scam message? i.e. What kinds of information do you think give away the scammers, and what information really solidifies "trust" between the reader and scammer?  

Question 2: Is there a trend in terms of the times/places the most convincing scams are born out of? Have you noticed that times of true strife yield the most artful scams?

Question 3: When you act out email scams, it gives them a certain life, yet the scammers still seem like they are speaking at a distance. If you have ever been approached in person by a stranger looking to scam you, you know the feeling of a more personal, bodily threat. What role do you think the email environment plays in the success/failure of these scam artists?
