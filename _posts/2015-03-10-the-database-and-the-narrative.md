In his article, "The Database", Lev Manovich contrasts two basic forms of "cultural expression": the narrative and the database. While certain pre-digital forms of media, such as film and the novel, saw narrative as their primary form of expression, he argues that the introduction of new media objects shifted the focus to another form, the database. 

It seems obvious by their construction and material existence that digital media would favor this form: what is a CD-ROM but a digital storage device? Indeed, many early CD-ROMs and webpages served exactly that function: they contained encyclopedias, cookbooks, and other such collections.

This reading got me thinking about the recent emergence of interactive documentaries and other films. While the film pieces themselves, as well as the code implemented to interface with the viewer, can be viewed as databases, does the overall experience of the film constitute a narrative? I suppose it could be viewed as what Manovich calls an "interactive narrative", which can be "understood as the sum of multiple trajectories through a database". So, as long as the film itself accomplishes a narrative through each trajectory, it can be considered a narrative.

Linking this to the section of the reading that discusses algorithms, I wonder what would become of the interactive film if the code used to traverse the different pieces of film were to contain an algorithm. Picture this: a theater full of viewers, each with a smartphone application that input some data to an algorithm that used the aggregate data to decide where to go next. One could even include sensors in the seats, or on consenting subjects. I suppose that, as the algorithm became more complex, it would be more difficult to ensure that the film would progress- based on the viewer inputs- in a narrative manner. 

However, this may not be the objective. Like some filmmakers discussed in the reading, the goal of the film might be to show a sequence of unrelated clips, with no semblence of narrative, or a questionably-present narrative?

And what of these films with a questionably-present narrative? Are there not films that may or may not meet the criteria of having a narrative, depending on how you view them? What if the narrative is gleaned by each individual viewer, in their own personal way? For example, the film Decasia by Bill Morrison has no real discernable plot, but the themes and subject of mediation seem clear to me, though others with whom I have discussed the film have come to other conclusions. Some films, such as Baraka (directed by Ron Fricke) or Koyaanisqatsi (directed by Godfrey Reggio), have more consistent themes and actors, but still contain more mediations on themes, rather than an archetypical story. Is there room in his theory for films that toe this line?

Furthermore, all narrative requires interpretation by a viewer. Is our idea of what constitutes a narrative not socially constructed? Are there films that might be interpreted in having a narrative in one time/place/culture, but not in another (due to things such as references to current events, cultural artifacts, or cultural phenomena)?
