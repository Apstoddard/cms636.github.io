This weekend, I had the privilege of attending Terry Riley's 80th birthday concert. For those who don't know, Riley is widely known as the man who revolutionized modern music composition. 

In my limited exposure to modern music compositions, it seems that much of the work done by contemporary composers involves the exploration of sonic technologies' capabilities. For example, during the concert, two musicians played a piece commissioned for Riley's birthdsy, "A Trilling Piece for Terry" by Pauline Oliveros, which involved tapping various parts of a grand piano, including- but not limited to- the keys. This is an example of an exploration of non-digital sonic technology.

However, as mentioned in this article, some artists experiment with digital recording and playing devices. One example is Alvin Lucier's ["I Am Sitting In A Room"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jU9mJbJsQ8). In this piece, Lucier records a track of his voice explaining the piece in a room and proceeds to play it back, recording the playback and playing and recording that recording. This recursive loop of recording and playing distorts the audio, making more audible the "natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech". 

Another example is Steve Reich's ["Pendulum Music"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU6qDeJPT-w). In this composition, microphones are hung as pendulums. They are pulled away from their resting point and released at the same time. When they pass close to each other, they produce a familiar interference, which varies in tone with the relative speed of the microphones. The piece lasts as long as the microphones continue moving in their pendulum motion. This piece involves no recording or playback, but instead explores the capabilities of pendulum motion and electronic interference. 

As the article notes, these two examples, among many others, bring "natural and artificial systems to the fore by putting a process or phenomenon ahead of the artist's personal "vision"." 

In a way, I feel that our Virtual Museum is related at its core to this concept. While our scraper will scrape a specific site (DeviantArt) for pictures, the
