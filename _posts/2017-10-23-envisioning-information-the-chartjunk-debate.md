## Envisioning Information: Color and Information

Tufte makes a strong case that color has the power to significantly affect the reading of visual information--both positively or negatively, depending on its usage. Lack of color may not adversely affect the information display, but bad usage of color can really inhibit one's understanding of visual information, such as a map.

He also proposes the use of color to display multidimensional information, due to its own inherit multidimensionality (color, hue, and saturation). The space of color isn't at all linear, nor is the whole of color space spanned by the primary colors (red, green, blue in this case). This means that color space doesn't behave like Euclidean 3-space, and mathematical operations cannot be performed as they would be there. The processing of 3-dimensional data also requires linearity, so in order to process color data, we must linearize the space of displayable colors (which doesn't really make sense to do in the first place--there is no "right" way to do this).
