In the **layering and Separation chapter**, Edward Tufte illustrated the "1+1=3 or more" theory in visual effects. He used different examples and comparison to show how effective layering of information can be achieved. For example, different colors, line weights, diagram shapes and arrangement of information layers can affect the relationships between layers.  He also criticized some old maps didnâ€™t differentiate information and suggested uneven information showed in Chinese and Japanese paintings could provide more meanings. While in my opinion, I would expect more discussions for this topic rather than using most of the words to criticize the dark or grey color which can better show the information. 

In the **Narratives of Space and Time chapter**, the author showed the difficulty of narrowing space and time in diagram designs. He used the examples- satellites of Jupiter, flight maps, train schedules, and encoding of dancing notations to show the practice of narrative designs. And he also imagined that in the future, the technology could help realized the dynamic representation of human itinerary. Nowadays, this point has been achieved. 

In the **Chartjunk Debate**, Stephen Few disagreed with Tufte's understand of what qualifies as useful expressions of information. In Stephen's view, some embellished information can provide more memorable effect to the audience. So it's not a simple attempt to justify what is chartjunk, even though Stephen agreed with Tufte's basic assessment. To make the argument more sound, he also conducted an experiment to testify his understanding. I think Stephen's example is limited to one specific catergory by choosing dramatic drawings. While the other examples he showed with changing colors is not solid and powerful as the drawings.
