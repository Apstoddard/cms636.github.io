### Problem Statement

Collaborative audio generation.

There is currently no very good way for people to collaborate on audio generation. Currently, one must have advanced knowledge of various complex software options which is not very accessible to your every day internet user. We would like to provide an avenue for people to contribute to and build from a centralized library atomic units of music generation.

### Approach

There’s a type of audio creation toolchain called Supercollider that lets you programmatically create music/sounds. You can define types of signals or modulations and then cascade them into new sounds which can also be operated on. We want to make a website front-end for this system. We envision a site which has a “block library” of sounds that each user can use in his/her sound generation. Additionally, multiple users can upload new blocks so that everyone can use them in their own designs. In this way, we will create a collaborative system for people to make new sounds.

### Audience

People on the internet who are interested in music generation and/or are bored.

### Skills Needed

- Knowledge of Web/GUI technology
- Javascript, Clojure, Object Orientation
- UI/UX
