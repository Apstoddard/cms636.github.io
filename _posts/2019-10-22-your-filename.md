Tufte is undoubtly the guru to modern day visualization. All three chapters (color, narrative, layering) provides arguments and examples that one can always agree upon. However, one thing that Tufte rarely touches upon is the visualization context of he graphical representations he proposes, or the subjectivity of visual language. The cognitive and perceptual techniques he proposes are effective method of distinguishing hierarchical data, yet it narrows the presentation of information to one method. 

The potential of spatial humanities is limited by the current, existing technology. GIS has potential, and hold massive amount of information that can act as the background to humanities research. Yet I don’t believe that the platform should be pushed out of its current, absolute context (reliable accuracy) to accomendate for a more fluid purpose such as humanities research. 

Questions: 
- Do you believe that Tufte’s principles of visualization is universal? 
- How do we interpret if something is a research project v.s. a representation project?
