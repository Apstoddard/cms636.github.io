## Time in Print
We see timelines as simply bare-bones summaries of complex historic narratives, but chronology was among the most revered of scholarly pursuits. Chronologies selected and organized diverse pieces of historical information, and the ways in which this is done (the choices made about what to include) reflect the priorities and visions of the world at the time of writing.
The modern form of the timeline is surprisingly a relatively recent invention- less than 250 years old.
Ancient and medieval historians used tables instead of timelines. During the Renaissance, the Eusebian model was dominant: a matrix with kingdoms across the top and years down the left hand columns. The matrix allowed rich representation of lots of information from multiple sources.
Joseph Priestley’s Chart of Biography in 1765 was the first chart to present a complete time map and compete with the matrix. It was criticized because history is not linear- it branches off into subplots with comparisons going back and forth in time. Nonlinear infographic techniques such as the diagram showing the size and attrition of Hannibal’s armies devised by Minard continue to call into question the promise of the straight line. I think that in fact it is rare nowadays to see timelines that are really nothing more than a one dimensional line, when it is so easy to add extra information.

## The Potential of Spatial Humanities
Critics of GIS claim that it rests on positivist epistemology by assuming the existence of an objective reality that we can discover through scientific method, when in fact knowledge is contingent on the perspective of the observer. GIS doesn’t accept uncertainty, and favors official accounts - which are influenced by money and power), while using Western measures such as Euclidean geometry and Boolean logic. 
However, I don’t think these criticisms prevent GIS from being a valuable tool even if it can’t capture all of the subtleties and ambiguities of the world. Bodenhamer observes that the “quantitative revolution” has yet to enter the mainstream of humanities scholarship, and explains it by the fact that humanists are drawn to questions and evidence that cannot be reduced easily to zeroes and ones. However I believe that quantitative evidence will always provide valuable insight or at least context in some form or another, and it is high time for quantitative methods to be fully embraced in humanities.
