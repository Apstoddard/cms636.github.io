title: Other applications for Thiel's VR Concepts

I found it really interesting that Thiel seeks ways to embed virtual spaces into "real" spaces without headsets or other more stereotypically "futuristic" VR equipment. It reminded me of an article that came out right after Facebook changed its name to "Meta," which argued that Minecraft already was a successful implementation of the "metaverse" concepts Facebook sought. At first I was confused -- how could Minecraft be considered virtual reality? -- but as Thiel outlines, virtual reality is more about using technology to build scenes that can help users form their own narratives than it is about weird goggles and gyroscopic controllers. 

In hindsight, it's this misconception that often makes me skeptical of things branded as "virtual reality;" too often I've seen "virtual reality" works that prioritize form over concept. Yet Thiel points to some truly powerful aspects of virtual and augmented reality: the ability to incorporate the user as the protagonist in the narrative; to use space unconstrained by actual physics as a storytelling device; to merge fantasy with reality, the physical aspects of a space with its legends. Beyond artistic applications, I wonder to how these abilities could be leveraged to better explain complicated scientific concepts for museum exhibits. There have been video games that attempt to simulate relativistic effects by bringing the speed of light down to an everyday level. Or a common thought experiment in quantum mechanics is, what if Planck's constant were large enough to observe quantum effects in daily life? Like the instruments in 19th century teaching labs, maybe VR/AR can be used to convert invsible aspects of strange physics into experiences.
