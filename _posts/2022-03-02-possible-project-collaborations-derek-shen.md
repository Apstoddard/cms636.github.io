title: Possible Project Collaborations -- Derek Shen

I could see my project idea working well with Trudy's, as we both are aiming to visualize human exploration patterns during museum visits through data. Both ideas look to incentivize visitor engagement through some form of representation/token that can be taken away after a visit. I also could see some relation with Riad and Camila's ideas of NFC usage to document your experiences/impressions with individual pieces of art. As an extension, this data could be used to further create a unique "story"/analysis for each different visitor's experience.
