##I am interested in a number of the projects that were proposed. I am not sure I have my own. Overall my year at Harvard is its own project. I am asking what the role of journalism should be in post-conflict societies and reconciliation. In this respect I am interested in how ideas spread, how empathy is built from images, and artifacts and if virtual experiences can be a useful tool. Briefly when I attended an intro to MIT by Ethan Zuckerman he had been tracing the spread of ideas regarding the last US election on twitter, (and singled out journalists.) The idea that you can trace and evolution of thought and visualize them (at least for a segment of an online population) was intriguing. As well when we visited the HR lab the way some people have used virtual reality to create empathy was interesting. So I don't have a project in mind yet. But I am interested in learning skills that (hopefully) will inspire an answer down the road.
