### Museum as Discursive Space

I found it particularly interesting how this article brought up power roles that are present in museum spaces between the "guests" and the "hosts," which is not something that I've ever thought about. I think the traditional museum setup definitely has these power dynamics, where the hosts certainly are inviting visitors to see their collection and take away a specific message. That being said, I haven't been to any museums that allow the user to "engage in a dialogue" as the article states. Most musuem experiences that I've had are pretty one-sided, though I could see how some museums of science fit into this description, as they tend to be much more engaging through their use of interaction rather than just showing.
