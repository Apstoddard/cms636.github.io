title: E. Tufte Envisioning Information - Layering and Separation

While the following chapter is specifically on color, (“Color and Information”) many examples in this chapter utilize color to create layers and differentiate information. A detail I found interesting was on the ascension and descension of letters, which I have noticed before with labels on diagrams and various visuals, but usually just regard as an ‘unfortunate circumstance’ that could only be fixed by capitalizing all letters, which is not always desirable for other reasons; however, Tufte’s example shows that this can probably often be fixed by a simple rethinking of the arrangement, and, as he said, little details like these can really affect the overall presentation and quality of the visual.

One of the main topics in this chapter is the use of space, with the ‘creation’ of negative space being a major point of discussion. This is definitely something designers should be aware of and utilize carefully. While Tufte seems to advocate for avoiding negative space, and provides examples on how to do that, I feel the contrast can be a strong visual component that strengthens or directs the viewer’s attention. This is probably exactly why the author suggests ways to eliminate these potential distractions, but I think there are instances and ways in which negative space can work for, and not against, the visual, though the designer should be careful, and focus on presenting the data, or conveying the message, in the best way possible.

This is ultimately the most important. What is the purpose and intent of the visual? What should be presented, and what should be emphasized? The design should be centered on these core questions, which, for example, would lead to the realization that borders, gridlines and other conventional graphical elements should assist and not obstruct the presentation of information. Design and form are not separate from function, rather, often shape or even dictate the quality of the product, and can disrupt the content when done poorly.

p.s. How come we don’t use annotation studio anymore, is there a specific reason? Although improvements can be made to the interface and platform, I find it quite helpful. Thank you.
