The most difficult part is the preparing stage. Since my computer does not have java, I tried to download it and I spent sometime figuring out how to run. The classifier command actually has finished coding to filter and select information. I just copy and paste texts from the annotation studio and the result is quite accurate. However, it is more like purly information selection and the interface is never designed in my eye. But the potential is for my understanding, it all depends how you carry out coding. If the coding aims at calculate key words, then the programmer just writes a certain coding sentences. The possibility is unlimited. But for me, this stage is more like scanning and general reading. The annotation studio is more for deep learning. Only if you are familiar with the content could you select by comments and broaden your horizon for more resources.
