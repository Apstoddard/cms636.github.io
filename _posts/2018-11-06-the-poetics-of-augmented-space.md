In his essay Lev Manovich talked about the increasing existence and importance of “augmented space”, which he defined as “physical space overlaid with dynamically changing information”. 

I totally agree with Manovich’s statement that the high-tech society is featured by the close connection between surveillance/monitoring and assistance/augmentation. The concept is illustrated in some of the interactive art installations at MIT museum. One example is the staircase that can sense people’s movement and play music responding to the movement, where the kinetic sensing is a form of monitoring, and the music is the augmentation. However, like most of the other installations in the museum, it doesn’t have the ability to gather more information about each individuals, therefore can only offer an universal experience to everyone. One potentially improvement, according to Manovich’s theory, is to ask all the interactive installations to collect more information about the specific user’s demography and preference, and provide a tailored experience based on that data. The improvement, however, is associated with even more surveillance and monitoring. In the essay, Manovich also talked about the transition in how galleries display work: from placing two-dimensional objects on a wall to using whole 3-dimensional space of a gallery. In the “Lighter, Stronger, Faster” exhibition that showcases marine design and engineering, the exhibition space is partitioned corresponding to the size of the drawings and physical models. In the “Advanced Visual Studies” exhibition, one of the artwork is a cubic dark room with moving lights projected to all directions, which allows the visitors to actually occupy the artwork.

Lastly, Manovich suggested that architects should take augmentation into consideration and integrate it into the design. In the case of the MIT museum, however, augmentations are always changing as the exhibitions are changing. What the architect can do is probably provide a “white cube”, as a canvas for the artists or exhibition designers.
