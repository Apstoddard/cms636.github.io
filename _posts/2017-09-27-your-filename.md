Hi, I am Ao Li, current first year master student in design studies from Harvard Graduate School of Design. I have an architectural design background as well as a dual degree in Urban Design, now my concentration is Energy and Environment in the design context. I have always been interested in human/environment computer interaction, UI/UX design and various methods and techniques in data visualization. From this course, I hope I can get to the right track of big data curation, editing and representation.
