I'm not great at outlining these so I'm just going to follow the sections outlined in the handout:

Problem Statement:
	Museums can be difficult to approach, occaisionally pretentious, and often expensive or difficult to get to. Also, many museums feature only works that could be considered "fine art" or otherwise well-known pieces in an accepted, established style. I want to create a museum that is easy to access, open to all types of artistic works, and most importantly, free.

Approach:
	The Museum a Day project is a virtual museum, automatically generated or hand-curated in special circumstances, that can either be explored in a browser or through the use of a Google Cardboard headset and a phone. I will cover the automated case, as a hand-curated museum is fairly easy to imagine. First, we gather art through a web-scraper, not only from established gallery websites that contain images and data on fine art, but also from websites such as DeviantArt, to gain a mixture of classically expected museum art, and strange, unconvential art from creators on the Internet.
