## Affective Induction Spa: Experiments in Programmed Emotions, S.A. Fish

  I know we were supposed to write about one of the 8 projects listed with metaLAB, however I ventured into some of the affiliate's personal portfolios and stumbled upon a performative project commissioned by the MFA about inducing experiences of emotional pleasure and happiness exploring the idea of programing emotion straight into the brain. Though it was a performative piece that used particular sensations to spark emotion, the underlying idea of participating in the intersection of science and art can be highly exciting for visitors and begs larger questions of the programability of the human experience. The approach to human engagement in the museum I feel is unique and unexpected in a museum like the MFA, where the primary focus is more traditional art and objects, bringing new persepctive to experiencing the art and interaction with others within the museum.
