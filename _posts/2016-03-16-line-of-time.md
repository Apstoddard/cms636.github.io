title: Line of Time
---

The reading assignment explains that the visual representation of chronology as a line is a relatively modern invention. I found this to be interesting. It is natural to think of time as a line or arrow since time does not diverge, cycle, or move backwards. It is also not surprising that the linear representation of time is a recent invention since the representation of mathematical functions using a pair of axis was not always a technique that humans employed, although today we take it for granted. I believe the representation of time as a one-dimensional axis is the most useful and appropriate, but it would be interesting to explore more novel forms of representing chronology.
