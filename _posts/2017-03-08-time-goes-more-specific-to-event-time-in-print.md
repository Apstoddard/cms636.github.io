**Time in my eye is a general container that everything happens continuously. Events is more like a selection of time where with specific aim or interest, specific points or period of time are taken for records. It has details and layers of information that could be read as a story.**

Timeline could be seen as a concept that people tried to draw time. It is a concept and has little to do with technological constraints although technology truly changes the tools of mapping time. So the discussion here does not relate to when certain methods are used but more for the thinking and concept behind. Annals is an example which the left and right column refers to time and what happened at that time. There is no category or distinction. The chronographic table is similar in principle and as Rosenberg said although research techniques and the exploration of many new forms, representations of time mostly continued to look very much as they had a millennium earlier.

What is truly an advance is the information selection and complexity in the time mapping. And this is what I call Event.

An example is the time mapping with category like the case of Gerardus Mercator. He collected astronomical evidence and use eclipses and other celestial events to record time. The measuring units no longer goes as day by day but as a cycle. Also in the Chart of Biography, life cycle of one famous figure is taken as one unit.

Another example is dealing with the not linear historical narratives and complexity. Minardâ€™s famous diagram of Russian campaign 1812-1813 could be seen as a paradigm to deal with complicated information of what factors influence the reduction of soldiers on the way. This kind of thinking trying to combine geography, climate and number of population on one map could be seen as a great progress in recording an event.

The graphics of historical representation is more about ideas and concepts.
