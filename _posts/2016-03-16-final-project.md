My final project idea is to visualize data on opensource github repositories such as when authors commit and which authors edit the same files or parts of files. I would like to be able to graphically display this information in a way that allows a viewer to easily see which users collaborated with eachother and see how the development of a project has progressed over time. I would like there to be a play back feature where a viewer can watch the development of a repository unfold one commit at a time.
