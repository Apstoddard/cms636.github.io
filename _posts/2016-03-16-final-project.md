##Project Title:
Open Source Github Visualization

##Problem Statement
It is difficult to see who collaborated on different sections of a project when all of the commits are viewed in list form. It is also difficult to see at what stages of a projects development different contributors were active.

##Approach
My final project idea is to visualize data on opensource github repositories such as when authors commit and which authors edit the same files or parts of files. I would like to be able to graphically display this information in a way that allows a viewer to easily see which users collaborated with eachother and see how the development of a project has progressed over time. I would like there to be a play back feature where a viewer can watch the development of a repository unfold one commit at a time.

##Audience
Both programmers and users interested in an open source projects development.

##Skills Needed
D3 knowlege to graphically visualize commits.
JQuery knowledge to make API calls to Github.
