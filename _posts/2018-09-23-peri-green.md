I am a May 2018 graduate of the University of Miami (FL.) and double majored in Business Technology and Education Policy. The field of EdTech peaked my interest early on in my undergraduate career and since then I have been searching for opportunities to be exposed to the field. Attending HGSE in the fall will be the first time I will be working and learning in a space that merges my two passions--technology and education.
