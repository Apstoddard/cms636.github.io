I am a graduate student in the Technology, Innovation, and Education Program at Harvard's Graduate School of Education. I am also a recent, May 2018, graduate of the University of Miami (FL.) where I double majored in Business Technology and Education Policy. The field of EdTech peaked my interest early on in my undergraduate career and since then I have been searching for opportunities to be exposed to the field. I'm excited to finally be working and learning in a space that merges my two passions--technology and education.
