### Play with Art

**Description:**
Most virtual exhibitions use AR or VR technology to help visitors immerse themselves in the exhibition and learn about the details, context, and meaning of the artwork. However, few online exhibitions provide visitors with interactive activities that change the one-sided way of viewing. Therefore, this project aims to design and develop interactive and entertaining online activities that combine visual art with other art forms, such as auditory and expressive arts, to give the viewer a different experience.

Examples may include:

1) Different parts of the painting can emit different music depending on the figure and color of the painting. The viewer can also create new music by choosing the type of music and atmosphere.

2) Painting splice：the painting can be jointed with different pieces to create a new atmosphere and expression.(Inspire by a TikTok trend)
