The section about transitioning from detoxing to decolonising was interesting and stood out to me. Even though an effort to encourage people from BAME backgrounds to interact, people from these backgrounds are still hesitant to do so because of the backlash they may face. 

While people are putting forth the effort to support those who are who are struggling, it is good to see people working hard to help others no matter how fast or slow they are progressing. It does bring up the question of how this topic can be discussed with people who may not be able to connnect with people of color. As everyone has a different culture, it can be difficult to be able to talk about harsh topics while being careful not to offend anyone in particular.
