Commentary on Augmented Editions Fluid Textuality 
By Karleigh Moore

I agree that curated and critical editions of classical works in particular is becoming more and more prevalent in academia. I think that these types of editions are an invaluable tool for those attempting to study such texts as they are often dense and at time, seem to be written in a different language. 

As a beginning student in philosophy, I much prefer reading annotated and contemporarily organized versions of classical philosophical texts. Most obviously, these help in regards to changes of the meanings of words over time and evolution of language, providing the historical background necessary to fully grasp the meanings and importance of the texts, and more. It is also a sign of progress and integrated scholarship to juxtapose original works of the classics with contemporary commentary, criticisms, and interpretations. Mostly, Iâ€™ve encountered these curation techniques in philosophy in printed text formats. But I do think that it is both possible and probable to translate these techniques for philosophy to an online or digital form. In fact, I think it would make the reading process more efficient and engaging and less painful if these works were presented in a digital and more interactive format.

I can recall reading an edition of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet where the left page was the original text in Shakespearean English and the right page was a modern English translation. It could be intellectually enlightening and certainly entertaining to see a similar side by side translation applied to the infamously impassable works of Aristotle.
