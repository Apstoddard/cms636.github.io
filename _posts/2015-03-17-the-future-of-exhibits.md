I never really went to any museums as a child. It seemed like a place only for sightseeing--a place targetted only at tourists. I didn't like to travel, so I never did too much sightseeing, so museums weren't a place I saw. It's only growing older I've started to appreciate them more and enjoy visiting.

In light of that, I think the future of museums still holds promise. Art did not die when photography came about. It evolved. In the same way, I think museum exhibits are becoming more and more about the experience of walking through and being there. My friend even told me how she went to one museum recently with an exhibit on sound and vibrations and how they affect your body when you sing. (This is right across the Charles, in fact, and designed by someone from MIT.) I think these kinds of interactive exhibits are the direction that museums are taking, and they have a lot of potential.

For libraries, there's not much I can speak to because I hate looking at books in libraries. It will never be a place I would feel excited or even comfortable exploring. It could never be that third place for me. Oddly enough, it is because I don't like the physical aspect of the experience--being there, picking books from the shelves. (Note: I do love reading for fun.) I'm not really seeing how museums and libraries could work together, as is suggested by the piece. I will stick to my digital browsing.
