## notes on What Is A Museum?

This was exactly the question I had all throughout last week week when we began our discussions.

The concept that museums grew almost naturally out of human nature to collect makes a lot of sense to me. Even at the Museum of Science down the road, there is an exhibit of items "donated locally"--everything from personal Guinness-world-record collections, to a toy donated by a child. I've often wondered attitudes towards "collectibles"--funko pops, limited edition items associated with everything from video games to fast food, make-up collaborations between some of the most unlikely companies--reflect a surge of collecting-as-hobby or if it's simply a new faucet of an ongoing obsession. To me, in my limited view, it seems to have increased exponentially, and it feels tied to the speculated desire for immortality as noted in the text. The tangent I ask, then, is what makes a collection valuable or worthwhile? what will prove useful to a museum over time? The ancient pots and pans made in prehistoric times were certainly not made with the idea that it will be displayed as a tool of education; similarly, I assume many of us do not function in our day-to-day lives this way.

Alma Wittlin's anecdote, too, struck me in its temporal ambiguity--she notes the alienation some "normal" people may feel when suddenly introduced to a museum. This seems to be an attitude that persists, today even.

I found the section entitled "Changoing Definitions for Museums" especially interesting. It brings several quotes from those associated with different museums and in different capacities, and is a topic that is still quite modern. Arguably, although we are not fully divorced from old concepts of museums, we certainly have not (and maybe will never) reach a concensus on what a museum's role SHOULD be. Of course, some museums are easier to adjust than other--museums founded more recently have more ability to be conscientious of these questions, whereas older museums have to contend with recent demands to return culturally significant pieces from where they were stolen from. Obviously, there are arguments "for each side"--those who took the pieces insist they are "sharing it with the world" (while conveniently making money), while those from whom their pieces were stolen insist good intention doesn't make the act better. Adele Silver's quote regarding how the museum is not an eternal concept, but one that shifts with culture, struck me as extremely future-sighted, as well. 

The rest of this piece describes the nuance with which modern museums must deal with. Every aspect of a museum--from who pays for it to who enters it--brings up a new avenue of discussion, many without an easy or straightforward answer. These are things I think many never consider--while a museum nowadays has a role to play to the public, there are many deciding factors even before we decide on an audience. Everything affects a museum's collection. 

## notes on Before Museums: The Curiosity Cabinet as Metamorphe
This piece primarily made me think a lot on the topic i touched upon in the last few paragraphs--the role of a museum has shifted. But even more so, curiosity cabinets reflected a bleak (in my opinion) starting point for museums: often no more than a personal collection of items (sometimes bought, sometimes stolen, or animals killed and stuffed, or...). Yet at the same time, as I noted earlier, I feel as though collecting for personal fulfillment has increased in the last decade or so. Over what span of time will we find out the dark implications of today's collecting spree? there's commentary to be made, now, about how modern day collections belay nothing more than ideological decay thanks to consumerism, but will we see some issues with them in the future? 

And yet, the desire to define even curiosity cabinets by their "metamorphes" shows an inherent insight to understand our world that I, as a scientist, understand. Differentiating between items is an easy step in many sciences.
