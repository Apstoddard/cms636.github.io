Dorn's “First-Time And Repeat Visitors: What Makes A Satisfying Museum Experience?” was a solid paper that showed the quantitaive evidence for how museums can tailor their visitor experience to the demographics of their audience.

However, Pine and Gilmore's "The Experience Economy" reading really got me thinking. The whole time I was reading their paper, I couldn't help but compare every point to Disney World. The five principles to create a theme perfectly coincide with Disney World's mission to sell visitors happiness. The park alters guests' sense of reality and time by creating multiple spaces within a place with themes that all genuinely fit the character of the Disney brand. 

In particular, I kept thinking about the excellent design and execution of the EXPERIENCE of the Space Mountain roller coaster ride. The 3 minute ride can have a wait time up to 3 hours. However, Disney brilliantly immerses people waiting in a high tech space shuttle, complete with pointless screen controls and intercom briefing surround sounds. The ride itself is fun, but I remember loving the moving walkway that escorted you from the ride to the gift shop afterwards. The  ENTIRE experience of Space Mountain was fun. I always had enough positive cues to nudge me in the right direction and a healthy balance of sensory stimulus throughout. 

Here is an example walkthrough of Space Mountain from 2011: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60TEWWdwIEs
