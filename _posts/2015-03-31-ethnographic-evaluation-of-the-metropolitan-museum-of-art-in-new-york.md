I was fortunate to have the opportunity to spend a few days in New York over break, where I visited The Met.

Upon entering the space, it was evident how broad the audience and museum goers was. There appeared to be a great deal of diversity, while this could be surface level, it would be interesting to have a more detailed breakdown on the socioeconomic and educational background of the museum goers. I appreciated that at The Met, you are not required to pay a set fee, there are suggestions on the price that one should pay, but the individual has the power to chose what they want to pay for an entrance fee, whether than be $1 or $500, I believe this removes a large barrier that potential museum goers may worry about, it is considerate to ranges of economic statuses. 

In regards to the technology in the space, I was very underwhelmed. Apart from text and arrangments of materials in varying physical manners, there were hardly any ways to engage with the material in a digital manner. There was an audio tour offered for around $7 and around the museum there were very few people making use of it. I am not a fan of audio tours for several reasons. I believe museum going can be largely social, and such social interactions can faciliate greater depth of understanding and engagement with the art, audio tours do not allow for social interactions, but rather restrict it completely. Additionally, with audio tours, I find that the user is prompted too quickly on what to think on particular works of art, rather than having an opportunity to explore and engage with the art. I would of have liked to see digital displays and interactive text fields.
