## Questions for Ann Neumann

How do you keep the AI exhibit from going out of date in a few months?

Many of the state-of-the-art models are currently proprietary and may not be fully understood, so how do you work around that when designing an exhibit?

How long did it take to design the AI exhibit what was the timeline like? How long will it take to react to current changes?

How is the AI section of the museum going to deal with Marvin Minsky and his controversy?

Who made the poem generator? Was it fine-tuned in hours by the MIT Museum made in a lab, etc?
