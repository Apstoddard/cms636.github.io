Over the past week the content of our webpage was finalized, the moods and the tags, (reasons for the users’ moods). We made further progress on the design, utilizing templates online that would complement the data visualization page, and applying our previously developed design concepts. We’ve thought more about the UI and UX, and now have a coherent layout that should allow easy navigation and quick interactions, while also including space for some information on the project if the user wish to know more. On the programming side of things, the basic framework is done, with the ability to retrieve and display the data live, ie display the data on the visualization page right after a user submits.
