I think traditional techniques used in the humanities (as laid out in the SG to DH), especially the use of evidence, are not suitable to some enormous bodies of texts in the digital space. The challenge is not necessarily in the scale of the dataset, but in the number of authors.

Historically, humanists have studied works created by a single author, or a small number of authors. The author (or authors) has a plan for the work. He/she writes each line or paints each stroke with a purpose, and he/she knows the overall message. But, as the number of authors grows, as in some of the datasets mentioned in “Scale: the law of large numbers”, none of the above statements are true. 

For instance, consider a set of tweets in a given week (Digital_Humanities says there are about one billion tweets a week). A humanist approaches this “text” and aims to make an insight into human culture. The problem is, traditional techniques may not work because this text has millions of authors. None of the authors knows all the other authors. They do not know how each individual tweet fits in with the others. And they do not know the “message” of the entire set. 

For every piece of evidence supporting a claim, there are thousands arguing the contrary. Humanists may have to abandon close reading altogether and opt for distant reading (see “Distant/close, macro/micro, surface/close”) exclusively. Effective arguments devote more time to aggregates and trends than to any specific piece of the text. And sometimes, there may be no effective argument for a specific observation.

Large multi-author texts such as the set of blogs, set of Facebook posts, or set of tweets are resistant to the traditional weapons of the humanities. Humanists must use new tools like distant reading to derive insight from a chaotic, contradictory, and seemingly purposeless text. Finally, when seeking trends instead of specific textual evidence, they must accept that sometimes, the best way to read the text could be to not read it at all.
