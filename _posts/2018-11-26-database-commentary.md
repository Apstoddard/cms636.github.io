This article mainly discussed the relationships between database and narrative. It talked about how the user of a database traverses it and then gets a narrative from it. I liked how these interactions were described throughout but did not like how things like the internet were analyzed in terms of narrative. For example, I have no problem with the internet just being a massive collection of items that may or not be related to each other. Unless a specific narrative is explicitly given by a medium, in cases such as the internet it makes sense for the user to make his own narrative. The author described the relationship between databases/algorithms to tangible actions and objects. I do not think we really think about these sort of relationships when we read the news, watch a movie, study for an exam, etc, but doing so can potentially lead to gaining a deeper understanding of our surroundings.
