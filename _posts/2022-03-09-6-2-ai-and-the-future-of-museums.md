I had 2 major takeaways from this paper

1. I am guilty of always framing the use of AI as something to be used to enhance the visitor experience. This is probably because I have only ever been a visitor at a museum (not a curator or adminstrator). However, I liked the "Behind the Scenes" section that made the point that AI will be increasingly powerful for the institutions in the backend. For example, it will be a huge time saver to use sentiment analysis on visitor feedback.

2. I liked the point that the emergence and acceptance of AI as digital culture will create "a world of have and have nots." AI is trained on models and datasets. And this training can be expensive. As we learned last week, a lot of the current models are optimized for businesses which includes lots of short form media. If we want to tailor a model to be used in museums (which encourages deep learning and connection making), inevitably new machine learning models will have to be funded and developed.
