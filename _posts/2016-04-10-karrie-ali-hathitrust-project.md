## About the Time Machine project

Using text data from a monthly student publication, we will explore ways to reveal "what it was like" to be a Chinese student in the U.S. in the early part of the 20th century.  The use of HATHITrust digitized materials is partly to help understand how libraries can be the bridge between large digitized bodies of information and researchers who do not necessarily have the skills of time to make them usable as datasets rather than online books for reading.  Libraries want to present information in its most usable form to researchers, and not be locked into only offering discovery and use of books, articles, etc.
