1. Historically what type of research/projects have you shown? 
    1. Are there any shifts in content you want to want to make? (specifically underrepresented backgrounds)
2. What are the methods for interactivity? Research and innovation should be exciting. How do you make sure to highlight this?
3. What are the limits of the exhibits you can have? Are you limited by funding, skills, space, etc? 
    1. What are some of the tradeoffs that you have made?
4. Since you are moving into a larger space, how will that affect your exhibits?
5. What are the backgrounds of your curators? What are the gaps in their skills or experiences in relation to the exhibition content? How do you mitigate some of these gaps?
6. What is your approach with presenting cutting edge innovation? How do you make it accessible to a general audience while still being able to emphasize how cutting edge the technical research may be?
7. Who has the audience been and how do you want it to evolve? 
8. Do you work with local schools? What does that look like?
    1. Does exhibit development mirror local curriculum at all?
9. For Debbie personally - which exhibit are you most excited about? Whatâ€™s the most difficult part of moving the museum?
10. How do you view your role as a community center within the larger Boston+Cambridge community? How has Covid-19 affected this?
11. Your first mission is to highlight the innovation and research from the MIT community. However, there are lots of cultural factors surrounding this (ie race, gender, oppression, inequality). How do you navigate presenting innovation while being culturally concious?
