Chapter 1:
	Reading about how museums originally restricted the visitor's physical contact is since our project is aiming to do the opposite to engage visitors more. The reasons for our projects are also mentioned in the thesis, such as visitors not being satisified with just viewing the objects in a "white cube." As stated, the objects in a museum should not just be preserved but also be engaging to others.
    
Chapter 4: 
	I found the "Permanent Installations: Rijksmuseum van Oudheden" case study the most interesting. With a permanent or semi-permanent installation, they not only have objects you can interact with, but also are more likely to intrigue both returning and new visitors rather than a large number of new visitors each time which could overwhelm the exhibit.
