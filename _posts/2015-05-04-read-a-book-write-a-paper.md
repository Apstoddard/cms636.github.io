Reading Jenkins, et al, I think it would have been a useful text in identifying the issues in my high school's humanities curriculum.

In high school, our English classes revolved around reading a book and writing a paper. There was no use of digital tools (ex. class website), and our paper was read only by the teacher. Furthermore, we focused only on the original text - no derivative works or annotated editions. While this is partly justified because it is expensive to train staff to use digital tools, it did a poor job preparing us for future literacy. I am thankful that my interest in computers allowed me to learn these digital tools eventually, but I wish that they had been a part of my high school humanities education.
