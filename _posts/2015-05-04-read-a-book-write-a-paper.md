After reading Jenkins, et al, I was disturbed to realize how poorly my high school humanities curriculum reflected in the principles of designing for future literacies.

My high school often had budget shortages, so computers and other technology was outdated and limited. In addition, many of the teaching staff did not grow up tech-savvy, so training them to use digital tools may may have been to expensive or time-consuming. As a result, the curriculum basically boiled down to this: "Read a book, write a paper".

In essence, each class would focus on a few books. For each book, about two weeks were devoted to reading it and discussing it in class. The remaining week would be used to write a paper (often a critique) on the book. The paper would be read by the teacher, and the student would receive a grade.

Looking back, I think there are number of ways to improve the curriculum above even without buying technology for the school. Here is one way:

**Address the Participation Gap** Submitting a paper for a teacher is a very limited form of participation. While class discussions aimed to increase participation, they too were limited in success. To address this, it would be valuable to have students work with each other in multiple participatory roles. For instance, allowing students to share papers with others and receive peer feedback exercises the role of the creater and the commentor. Furthermore, offering different assignment types - perhaps a short skit, an art piece - instead of only allowing a paper, would allow students to develop new skills. Finally, by approaching assignments iteratively (i.e. several drafts) and providing feedback on each step, rather than requiring one rough draft and one final draft, would encourage students to experiment with different approaches and fix problems earlier.

Being at MIT, we see many ways the School of Humanities encourages new literacy. However, I hope my high school serves to illustrate that this is not true everywhere and that it is possible to adopt new literacy approaches even in a low-tech environment.
