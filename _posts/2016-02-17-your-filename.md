1)   Where do the authors of scam emails draw their inspiration from? Could it be from personal experiences, from their creative imagination, or do they simply copy other well-known scam messages?

2)   If we were to perform an educational campaign to reduce the number of scam victims, what type of message would be most effective to send? In other words, what general guidelines would help people avoid becoming prey to such emails?

3)   Do you believe people fall victim to email scams because of a lack of wisdom or because of an emotional need? Do you think someone who is very smart and internet savvy could find themselves falling victim to such a scam because of emotional stress and insecurity?
