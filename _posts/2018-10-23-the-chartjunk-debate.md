title: The Chartjunk Debate
author: Priya Pillai

Stephen Few argues a more moderate approch in the chartjunk vs. embellishment debate-well designed embellishments, when conveying simplified data, can help serve as a mnemonic to remember data, but can become chart junk when attempting to look at more complicated analyses of data.

He comes to this conclusion on the basis of a paper on the usefulness of embellishments. In this paper, the authors have 20 students look at either "embellished" charts or "minimalist" charts to compare which improved recall. They found both were equal in the short term, but in the long term embellishments do better. Few takes issue with this conclusion, as the study took what Few considers to be some of the most well designed embellishments by Nigel Holmes and pits them against poorly designed minimalist charts that even the strongest hater of chartjunk Tufte would despise for a lack of clarity. The study also focused only on graphs with relatively simple messages, as Few doubts that the same conclusion would be drawn with more complicated data. The limited sample size also skews the results-we cannot base everyone's understanding on a few college students who likely have some familiarity with charts.

Few states the following modified conclusion from the study:
> When a simple message—one that could be expressed verbally in a single sentence—is presented in a chart that includes embellishments relevant to that message, along with quantitative values that are related to but incidental to the message, then a reader will comprehend the message as well as he [sic] would had the graph lacked embellishment and will also better recall the basic subject of the chart and pattern in the data two or three weeks later, but no better soon afterwards

While Few criticizes the study for drawing broad conclusions based on a limited sample size, he does the same, drawing his own conclusions based on his own presumptions and instincts on the matter. This is not to say he is necessarily wrong; simply, I claim that Few has little more evidence for his argument than does the paper. 

That being said, I do think Few's argument has flaws. Few does state that chartjunk is too broadly defined in Tufte's work, but Tufte has roughly the same definition that Few does. Tufte does argue that as long as it supports the work's meaning, it serves a purpose. Few, however, includes Holmes' works in the category of supporting meaning. However, by Few's own admission, Holmes' embellishments do NOT add meaning; rather, they add memory. Drawing a woman on a chart about diamonds will make you remember what the chart looked like, but it gives you no additional understanding of the underlying data. It is an artificial construct that is separate from the data, and when it overwhelms the chart, it can obscure the actual meaning of the data to one small conclusion.

While reader engagement and memorability is a valid goal, Few acknowledges that if they impede understanding, embellishments become chartjunk. In the case of Nigel Holmes' work, they limit readers understandings to only the most basic of conclusions, and are therefore excellent examples of chartjunk.
