## A New Post


A graph might not convey the full story in a data set but it should be designed to present the ideas in a rich way.
The author examines the use of data in different scenarios whereas he tries to specify how the visual representation affects the viewer and helps in communicating the message in a more effective way. 
Discussing the different scenarios, on a scale ranging from an excessif embellishment to a very minimal rendering points out the importance of the designer in the choices they make to use the proper communication representation in coherence with the data used. 
The way Holmes’ chart introduced embellishments was not useful to convey the message because it engages the audience’s brain in a distractive way (metaphor) rather than a focused way on the data.

Moreover, Stephen Few points out a very important concept on the interrelation between the simplicity of the message and the visuals conveyed that would enable us to state the message in one sentence.This is a very important component to be taken into account while design for a data visualization because we tend to get lost in the compelling representation while forgetting the focus of the message.
