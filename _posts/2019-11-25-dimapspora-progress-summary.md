**Data**

**Technological Approach**
	
The past week we focused mainly on the technological aspect of our projected in order to create a working prototype. We are becoming much more familiar with the QGIS software that is used for our visualization, as well as the QGIS2Web plugin that allows us to create an interactive web interface. We dedicated a lot of time into getting the  web plugin working and hosting the interface on a GitHub Page, which proved to be more challenging than expected. Now that we have succeeded in doing that, the focus will be on learning to customize our interface by better understanding the plugin. 

**Visual Design**

Since the technological aspect of our project took much more time and effort than expected, we havenâ€™t yet been able to fully implement our design ideas. However, we have mockups that will be used as guides as we figure out how to customize using the plugin.
