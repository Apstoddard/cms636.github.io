Title: Audio "Library"

Description: To improve accessibility and physicality of audio collections, create a set of small objects (e.g. 3D-printed "cassette tapes" or "records") that can be interacted with by museum visitors. These objects have hidden RFID tags or other digitally scannable labels so that when one is placed on top of the audio player device, the relevant audio file is played. Visitors can create their own groupings of these physical objects to leave their story for the next visitor. Curators can create groupings via non-locational cues like the color, shape, or title of the objects. Ideally these can also have Braille titles or other features to really augment accessibility of the exhibit.

Audience: Primarily-audio exhibits

Potential museum collaborators: MIT Museum

The technological approach: 3D printed objects + RFID tags + scanner attached to a computer that stores the audio files (inspired by the Cambridge library self-checkout technology)

Skill sets: object prototyping (ideally CAD/3D printing, but woodworking/foamworking/sculpting/etc also ok for small scale project), RFID tagging, minor database manipulation/retrieval
