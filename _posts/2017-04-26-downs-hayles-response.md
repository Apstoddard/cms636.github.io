close reading:
	"heterogeneous and largely unorganized set of practices and assumptions" (Peter Middleton)
    "symptomatic reading": "wrench a text's ideology into the light" by analyzing the context, the overt, as well as the omitted.
    (Reference how to deconstruct almost anything)
hyper reading: reader-directed, screen-based, computer-assisted reading
	but this existed in the past, as she mentions of researchers (John Guillory)
    "In digital environments, hyperreading has become a necessity. It enables a reader quickly to construct landscapes of associated research fields and subfields; it shows ranges of posibilities; it identifies texts and passages most relevant to a given query; and it easily juxtaposes many different texts and passages."
    
    "May involved with changes in brain architecture that makes close reading more difficult to achieve."
    
    Hyperlinks tend to degrade comprehension rather ahn enhance it -- but how is this defined?
    	writing a summary and completing a multiplee chocie test
        Doesn't mean that readers aren't elarning, just that they aren't focusing on that particular passage
        hyperreading useful to determine what to read closely. When given hyperlinks, implicit direction to explore what they link to, which are implicitly relevant to the current material.
        
       	No test that says: those who hyperread often are worse at close reading
