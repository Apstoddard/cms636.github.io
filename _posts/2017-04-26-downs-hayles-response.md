close reading:
	"heterogeneous and largely unorganized set of practices and assumptions" (Peter Middleton)
    "symptomatic reading": "wrench a text's ideology into the light" by analyzing the context, the overt, as well as the omitted.
    (Reference how to deconstruct almost anything)
hyper reading: reader-directed, screen-based, computer-assisted reading
	but this existed in the past, as she mentions of researchers (John Guillory)
    "In digital environments, hyperreading has become a necessity. It enables a reader quickly to construct landscapes of associated research fields and subfields; it shows ranges of posibilities; it identifies texts and passages most relevant to a given query; and it easily juxtaposes many different texts and passages."
    
    "May involved with changes in brain architecture that makes close reading more difficult to achieve."
