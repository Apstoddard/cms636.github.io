## Project Idea

My main idea is to create a platform for spatializing histories of marginalized identity groups/communities around Boston. First and foremost, the platform would be an interactive map where various historic events, people, places, etc. would be on display. Users can toggle the map via a timeline function to see how things have changed over time. It would also allow users to filter categories of histories by topic. Secondly, the platform would serve as a means to connect community activists to local resources and share ideas. Lastly, the platform would allow individuals to archive their histories via an input field, with geolocation and option to add attachments.

Secondary idea would be to create an online, mobile archiving machine that again would spatialize histories but would be less complex than the idea suggested above.
