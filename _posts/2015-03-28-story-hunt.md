#Title
Story Hunt - automatically generate visualizations to inspire data stories

#Problem Statement
When we searched for data stories with the CFRP data, we realized that finding an interesting data story is not easy. You can try making various visualizations and graphs until you find something interesting. But, with so many variables + visualization types, this can be a time consuming process. Furthermore, it's possible that you may completely miss an interesting story in your data. It would be useful to have a tool to assist in the hunt for a good data story.

#Approach
Story Hunt is a piece of software which scan your dataset in search of interesting patterns. When it finds them, it will generate a set of visualizations to support each pattern it found. These patterns can be used as inspiration for a data story, or as the data story itself.

#Audience
[Data journalists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_journalism "Data journalists") must work with datasets and search for a story of interest. Story Hunt may make their jobs easier.

#Skills Needed
Programming, visualization, and/or statistics
