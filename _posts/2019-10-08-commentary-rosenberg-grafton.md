These readings make me reflect on my own education, because the historically and socially situated representations of the timeline and the map were so prevalent. It definitely points toward a positivist tendency, as Rosenberg and Grafton bring up on p21. Especially when it came to older historical events such as the American Revolution and World War I, we focused a lot on maps and datesâ€”-data from measurement of time and space. These data silently normalized colonial naming conventions, and filtered our thinking through the lens of Euro-American ethnocentrism. It wasn't really until we got to JFK and Vietnam that any sort of human subjectivity was explicitly offered in our history education. And I have to imagine that's partly because that's when my teachers or their parents were alive to experience it firsthand. It's weird how cultural memory works--at least in classroom settings, history gets flattened and loses its emotional intensity after a few generations. I personally could not stand history class because I hated memorizing names and dates. But historical knowledge is so much deeper and more interesting than that.

I think Rosenberg & Grafton are a little bit too in love with the time-map idea. It provides only some additional affordances. However, I did really enjoy the breakdown of the matrix style representations towards timelines and then towards time-maps. I'm especially fascinated in Chapter 4 at these ideas to condense _all of history_ into these single charts. It was a much less specialized time in terms of academia and historical study. But it's obvious how much is lost in such a condensation.
