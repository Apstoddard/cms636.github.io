### Ethics and Anonymization:

This section (5) reminds me of a post I recently saw on news.ycombinator.com, which basically demonstrated that people could be uniquely identified based on a surprisingly small amount of phone call records. The point here, was to show that the claims that the government makes about how they first "anonymized" data before collecting it from cell carriers was blatantly transparent. 

It's interesting to think that the very tools that give us the ability to glean insight about the world we live in and the people around is are the same tools that make it hard to do such things without compromising the privacy of the data producers.

###  Knowledge is Power

As this section (6) points out, we are living in an age where a handful of companies control inordinate amounts of data, and access to that data. This creates a rift between those in the groups with access to the data and tools, and those without. Unfortunately, as the ‘goodness’ of the data and tools improves, this rift will be more apparent and more important.

The fact is, most of us here at MIT are in the ‘privileged’ group, in the sense that we benefit from MIT’s extensive reach, are likely to be the ones scooped up the the Googles and Facebooks of our time, and are generally quite computer-literate. This means that there’s not just little incentive to fix this problem, but in some sense there’s incentive for us to **not** fix it, because doing do would knock ourselves out of the ‘privileged’ class.

Of course, this isn’t to say that we shouldn’t confront this problem (which I would assert is one of the side effects of Open Source), more of an observation that those in direct benefit are those who must drive the change. Considering this, it’s not too hard to see why this class rift could get a lot worse before it gets better. Creating deep societal rifts is not something that we should be supporting - even if we are the beneficiaries.
