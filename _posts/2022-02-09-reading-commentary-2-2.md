The 21st century media landscape is increasingly dematerialized and infinite. Media objects are constantly being produced through social media posts, texts, and videos. And most of the platforms we use shift to keep pace with the exponentially increasing volume of information. Tik Tok uses a highly tailored suggestion algorithm that reaches into the corners of the app to deliver content a user wants to see. And Netflix has advanced suggestion algorithms that will change the thumbnail of a movie based off user behavior to increase click rates.

The Enhanced Critical Curation chapter states..

> "the mere existence of vast quantities of data, artifacts, or products is no guarantee of impact or quality. To curate is to filter, organize, craft, and, ultimately, care for a story composed out of—even rescued from—the infinite array of potential tales, relics, and voices." 

Contrary to popular media platforms, we shouldn't curate just based off what the user will click on. We should move away from strictly algorithmic suggestions and turn to human selections that tell a story that will resonate with (and sometimes challenge) the audience.
