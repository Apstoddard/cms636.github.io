I really related to the concept of "constructivist learning," which frames learning as an active process, and feel that it must be at the core of "interactive" exhibits for them to be meaningful. I'm a bit on the fence about having visitors directly handle actual artifacts; I think it can be OK if done in a careful and controlled way, but I also don't have so many qualms about the "authenticity" of replicas and think they can be a viable way to balance conservation with hands-on learning.

I found the "Sights and Scents" case study the most interesting, because I've never really thought about incorporating smells into a museum experience. However, it is a very integral part of interactions with plants. It made me think about our earlier discussion on whether botanical gardens are a type of museum. The amount of context given in the Cloisters exhibit makes me think that a garden isn't necessarily a museum, but if it provides context and information about the plants it contains or the gardening methods used, it can be.
