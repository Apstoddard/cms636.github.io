The three chapters in “Digital Memory and the Archive” by Wolfgang Ernst brought out some very interesting ideas, even though I’m not familiar with some specific words. But the whole idea is that Archive has become a new dynamic method in digital media Vs. traditional archive. And in dealing with art, music and video, the digital archive need to focus on the aesthetics inherent. And also the author argued about the temporarity of storage memory in modern technology. The computer as archive part reminds me of the transformation of modern computers. Different from the concept the author addressed here, I found it more interesting to see how can people archive the experience of using different computers in different stages.  When I studied the game design class, the professor chronological showed us different games and the computers which represented that age. Computer as significantly artificial product is also worthy of being documented and represented.
