Per last week's update, we have decided on a final deliverable. We will sketch polygons formed from the distances between words in the religious texts, onto acrylic sheets so that the audience can view comparisons between the texts. Ultimately, taking digital data and transforming it into something physical. 

We are testing out two ways to compare the religious texts. First, we are testing out our original plan to determine distances between words and sketch out polygons using just those determined distances. Our second method that we are currently testing, is to examine the concepts that derive from the texts and comparing the texts across concepts. 

Next Steps: Decide which method is more accurate and tells the best narration of the texts. Sketch the remaining concepts/words onto the acrylics.
