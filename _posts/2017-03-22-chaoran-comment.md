#Curatorship as Social Practice#

> What is the role of culture in the perception, care and treatment of objects and in their transmission through time?  

This reminds me of different perspective in the historical conservation of the historic architecture. Some architecture historians argue that repair these architecture as the original appearance is respecting the history. But other architects and historians think that adding the contemporary culture intot the historical buildings can be a responsible attitude towards the history. 

So how to preserve hte objects through the time should be an culturally issue. Should the pieces be shown as an objects which have faded its color over time or should they be repaired similar to what it is in the historical moment?


#	The	Museum as Discursive Space #

> We believe that this new approach— creating a “rhetoric of negotiation” between museumusers and institutions—will conﬁrm the power that museum-users have to establish their own outcomes,and continue to change howmuseum users inﬂuence existing museum narratives. Allowing users to include their own identities within their experience of the museum is likely to promote the culture of the users, rather than the traditionally dominant culture of the institution (which has decided, previously, what outcomes should be prioritized).


Jana Macalik says that the museum users of new generation frequently use technology for self-directed information-gathering and cultural consumption. However,I believe even in the last or even before generation, some users of the museum have their own ideas towards the how the objects should be displayed, what is the theme they want to explore in the museum. Indeed, the new technology may help the users' identities within their experience and ideas to be promoted. 

Besides, when the masses participate in the narrative of the museums, the masses are from different backgrounds with different perspectives towards the museum. Will their own identities within their experience of the museum deviate what the museum's should be? For instance, my cousin is a software engineer with little knowledge of contemporary art. He dislike the abstraction and the ambiguity of the comtemporary art, so, he hopes that most of the museums' exhibit and the narration can be easy to understand. That is also many people's wish.Although museum is a place to populize the basic knowledge, it is never a space of only to be that. So should the museum as a more straightfoward discursive space or keep its mysterious mask?That can be a question when the culture of the public has been involved in the narrative of the museum.
