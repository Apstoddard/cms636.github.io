### Thoughts from the readings

  A topic that we have discussed before that I feel is rekindled by the plaster recasting project is ownership and accumulating collection items. Because it is an artificial version of an original piece, the plaster pieces can be more easily distributed to local and smaller museums for a lower cost. The ability to produce these items could greatly increase accessability to new knowledge and experiences in a variety of communities and museums. Additionally, it removes the issue of ownership - the original artifact can remain in its cultural context while copies can be distributed for learning in museums (for example, ritual pieces that may or may not still  be in use today that museums hold in their posession). In addition to solving issues surrounding ownership, you can be really hands on without concern for the integrity of the artifacts. This can greatly help to contextualize historical pieces and allow audiences to connect more fully to the history.
  
### Questions for F. Torello
  
  -  What were your biggest qualms with the plaster recasting project?
  -  With the issues surrounding plaster casts being viewed in a more negative light (i.e. "fakes"), how do you feel this view could shift on both the sides of the audience and of the curatorial/museum associates? Do you forsee plaster casting becoming a more prominent technique?
  -  How do you think that these plaster techniques could be translational across disciplines beyond architecture?
