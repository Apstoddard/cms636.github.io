## The Black Experience at MIT,  Progress Update
  
  A brief update on our project:
  -  We are keeping original technology & floor layout plan (will be adjusted for an MIT Museum floor space)
  -  Will be meeting with Deborah Douglas at some point to discuss potential application of this project irl
  -  Currently listening to lots of audio from DropBox
  -  Deciding on preliminary audio topic sections & subsequent representational objects for RFID's
  -  Will soon use text matching from scripts to determine similar lines for euphonic effect
