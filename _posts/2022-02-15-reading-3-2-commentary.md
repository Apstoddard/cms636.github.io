# Cyber Animism and Augmented Dreams

Tamiko Thiel's short introductory paper to AR explores the promise of augmented layers in the real world. She was a pioneer in the AR scene in the 90s, and I'm sure she has tons of insight to the our current digital climate.

I came up with a few questions that I would've loved to ask Thiel if we got the chance to speak with her... 

In the 90s, the Internet was filled with ugly personal HTML webpages. The current media landscape however has pivoted to centralized social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The personal pages on these sites are more cookie cutter and restricted. As the Metaverse is being developed by Facebook, how does Thiel think that AR and VR will be affected by such a controlling corporation? Does she think the freedom promised by the Metaverse is a hoax?

I'm also curious what she thinks prohibited AR from taking off in the 90s? Does she think it will be adopted by the mainstream now?
