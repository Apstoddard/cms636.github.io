### Response to the Experience Economy

In the discussion of theming an experience, I thought it was really important to distinguish the ways in which doing so can be poor. I think theming an experience doesn’t work when it feels disingenuous to the purpose of the experience. For example, there was a Romeo and Juliet film that took place in modern day Los Angeles, and I think the story lost a lot of its dramatic weight and was a bit hard to be taken seriously. I wonder what other ways there are to distinguish good themed experiences from bad ones, and how to avoid coming across as “gimmicky”. 

There was also this notion of defining typical categories of themes, and I feel like some of those tropes can lose their appeal or become boring when we see so many consumer experiences sort of “default” to them, such as the wild west theme. I think as we’ve seen consumer experiences becoming a part of the economy, sometimes they fall prey to the types of cash grabs other goods have fallen pray to under capitalism.
