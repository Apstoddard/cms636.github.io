Like many people, I found myself agreeing with the article,  “The Recording That Never Wanted To Be Heard”.    Sonification is just another way to add depth to data or any piece of work. Translating information into a more sensory experience allows makes that information accessible to a larger audience.  My one concern is that, through repeated sensory translation, the actual information being relayed can get muddled or lost.  For instance, if you take data, and create a visual representation of that data, and then create a sonification of that data visualization, is the final product still an accurate representation of the original data?  Just as when one creates data visualization, one must be wary of the accuracy and clarity of data sonification.  However, I think it may be more difficult to determine the accuracy of sonification, which can lead to issues of data analysis and interpretation.  

If sonification is used properly, as a way to add depth and convey emotion to nuanced information, it can be a powerful tool for artistic expression and for exploring data in an unconventional way.  It is through this exploration and expression that data becomes interesting and more broadly understood.
