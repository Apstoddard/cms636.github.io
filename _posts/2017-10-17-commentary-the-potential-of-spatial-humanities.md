I really enjoyed reading Bodenhamer's piece because it so elegantly illustrated the effects space can exert on people and society. The description of the landscapes in the introduction alone replayed the images of the actual  history landscapes represent and how they are not only reflections of a time, but shape time (the American "Wild West") and society. With this in mind, I agree with Bodenhamer's claim that while useful for the quantative mappic of spatial data in urban planning and architecture, GIS hides the true emotion and complexities inherant in spatial data.
