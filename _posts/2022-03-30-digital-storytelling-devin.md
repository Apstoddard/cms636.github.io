I agree with the point that museums are a “special kind of experience”, and that being the main reason for the attraction. When I travel with my friends now, one of the first things we do in the place we’re going is research museums that are available there. They are places of learning for sure, but beyond that they are places where you associate knowledge with things more tangible. 
In the section of this paper on changing technology, I am reminded of our conversation with Debby Douglas at the MIT Museum. There was a robot in the museum, and we were asked how old we thought it was. Many of us thought it was a lot older than it was, and I think this reflects this idea that “state-of-the-art” technology advances so quickly these days that if some tech thing “looks” older, we might not give it the attention we’d give to something shiny and new.
