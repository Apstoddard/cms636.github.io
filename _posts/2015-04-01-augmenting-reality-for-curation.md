Reading Manovich's piece on augemented reality, I was struck by the similarities in his discussion of the "white cube" and the insight in curation, we had at the MFA. Manovich discusses a shift from "creating an object
that a viewer would look at" to "plac(ing) the viewer inside the object." He further describes a new challenge of integrating technology and newer modes of data delivery in these spaces. These descriptions reminded me greatly of Kristen Gresh descriptions of the curation process. I think the augmented reality that Manovich is describing in this section is actually the twenty-first century curators challenge.  Exhibit design, information provided, and extent of technology encorporation are all issues that curators face when putting together an exhibit.

When on my museum visit, I was looking out for the "white cube." I was a bit disappointed because I felt the MIT musuem had done better with this in the past. While the space was set up to feel industrial and lablike at some points, it was not as immersive as I have felt before. One interactive exhibit, which is no longer present, was a set of stairs that made different pitches at a delayed rate as you stepped on them. These stairs were necessary to view the upstairs exhibits so forced viewer to interact with at least one thing on their visit. I think this added a much need kick to experimentation and helped start the full experience.

Using this idea, I think some sort of introduction to the museum experience heightens the visitors engagement to the rest of the museum. To this end, I am hesitant to rely on mobile technology because the experience will be inconsistent. Some sort of sensors which react to someone entering can create an an engaging experience.
