**Lupton+Design+is+Storytelling:**
The great design of NYC subway map is a perfect example of design as storytelling, in that it is built upon the investigation of users’ exigency when imaging a map for subway system– the geospatial accuracy is not as important as clarity. The (good) designs are to tell a story based on the lives of its target users, in which case, scenario planning, design fiction, user’s journey.. become the key components in the story. 
Aristotle’s template of storytelling Lupton referenced and the diagrams in the file are clear representations of the story. However I felt that the alternative ways to tell a story was missing in the reading, for example non-linear Quentin Tarantino films, or some other play writing practice that is away from Greek civilization.

I like the strategic thoughts part, where Wyman, smith an dMeyers talk about the last resort as technology and technology as a design element. I personally like the sweet combination where the utilization of technology has a meaningful presence beyond its “technology.” A recent example I read is Ani Liu’s [Mind in the Machine: Psyche in the Age of Mechanical Production](https://ani-liu.com/mind-in-machine), Liu documented the internal brain motion of a textile worker during a day and used the electrical data to produce a piece of fabric. The technological application also symbolizes the alienation and exploitation of machine on workers and manifested through textile–the worker’s product.
