[The Venice Atlas](http://veniceatlas.epfl.ch/) is a multifaceted historical document of the city developed collaboratively by students in a digital humanities course. The atlas uses tools including timelines, mapping, and 3D modelling to present aspects of Venice history ranging from geographical evolution to musical traditions.
