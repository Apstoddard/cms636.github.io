## Response to "What is a Museum?"

I was intrigued to read that the civic nature of museums develops pretty early in America, with many partnering with schools. As I’m thinking about my own relationship with the museum, I’m seeing a lot of it is intimately tied to education. The first time I ever stepped foot into a building that had “museum” labeled on it was definitely on a school field trip, and probably up until my freshman year of college I visited the majority of the museums I had ever been to with or for school. 

I also enjoyed reading about the opening to the public of museums in America. I found it revealing that the issue of class in museums has existed since the early 20th century, with many visitors feeling othered in their first experiences with museums. It seems to me that in order to move towards a more accessible idea of a museum, sociological conversations like class, race, and gender will be vitally important. The museum becoming a public space means it is a microcosm for all these identities to interact. If we don’t think about how they will interact as an important principle guiding our design, I fear we’ll stay in a place where some feel like “aliens” as Alma Wittlin describes. I think this is summed up pretty nicely in Alexander’s description of the challenge of authority.
