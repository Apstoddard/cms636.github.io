## The Voice of AI
This exhibit has motion or presense sensors with light indicators projected to the floor to activate a recording of scientists talking about AI. What does it mean to stand there to activate the voice rather then just pressing a button? Perhaps this mode serves as more active engagement to force the viewer to stay with the exhibit and listen. 

## Arthur Gansan
This exhibit has motion/presense sensors in front of the statues to turn on the moving statue when someone is nearby. This can be a power saving mechanism. It also may serve as an invitation to engage since you must be close to see the details of the statue, and enchourage engagement.

## Virtual Tools Game
This is a screen with a physics game on it. It allows for interaction with the concepts, expands possible options to play, and gives the viewer agency. 


## Write a Poem
This is a visual screen that curves above the user that displays poems from museum visitors. Perhaps the use of AI means the use of tech to tie the expeirence together.
