## The Field Museum, Chicago

[The Field Museum of Natural Science](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/)is located in Chicago, IL. 

[SUE the trex](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/blog/sue-t-rex)(they/them) is known as one of the largest and best preserved T-Rex fossils and is displayed at the Field Museum. A quick search will show pages and pages about SUE from the standard wikipedia pages, to videos and "interviews" and many hashtags. SUE even has a beer named after them. Many people I know follow SUE on twitter. I visited the Field Museum a second time in order to meet SUE, pre-pandemic.

Now I may be biased, but I do think that the Field Museum has done an excellent job of making themselves seem like a place to visit--SUE is active on twitter and while they will participate in certain trends and make jokes, they always make sure to educate when needed and invite those to come visit. I think the accessibility of the Field Museum and the openness with which they allow interviews and social media to interact with SUE are really quite successful at engagement.

The effectiveness of the education value of these interactions/engagements, however, is arguable at best. Speaking from just my perspective, I've never bothered to look more into dinosaurs or archeology. 


## The Met
The Met, or the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has an extensive online database of its art and collections, and detailed information. Though I am no expert, I think they have certainly done very well in the aspect of presenting what is contained within. How do I know this?

...From Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH). ACNH was released near the start of the COVID pandemic, and became a huge part of many people's first months navigating lockdowns. There exists an in-game museum of art (and a science museum, too!) in which you can buy some of the most famous pieces of art and display them. Another function in the game was the ability to scan QR codes and link them to canvases in the game and display them at your home. [The Met connected their art to QR](https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/collection-insights/2020/animal-crossing-new-horizons-qr-code)codes for the game and voila! With a simple scan of a QR code from their website, and you could display pieces like [Bashi-Bazouk](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/440723) or [Joséphine-Éléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn (1825–1860), Princesse de Broglie](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/459106) in your in-game home. The pages also had information about the pieces you chose. 

While I can't speak to the effectiveness of this (I haven't visited the Met since for a number of reasons), I imagine it certainly inspired some interest in those who are able to visit.
