I was interested by the developing relationships and collaborations between the Chief Curator, Chief Engagement Officer, and Director of Education at the CMA. I found it interesting that curation and education are treated as inherently disjoint in the the museum space, and that the tonality of the paper almost suggested that the "education" component of exhibits needed to be tacked on to the art itself only after it was curated. It's as if, at least in traditional notions, there is a tradeoff between aesthetic and education/engagement. Even in the _Love and War_ gallery, the "Love Shack" had raving reviews from both visitors and the staff that put it together in regards to both aesthetic and engagement, but had critical reviews from "others" that felt it was weak and not "aesthetically compatible". I find the "tension" that was repeatedly mentioned throughout the paper to be hard to grapple with. Is aesthetic not just a constantly evolving notion within a larger social structure? And if so, do traditional practices have a place in museums? Is it not dangerous to hold aesthetic as a barrier to change? I, for one, believe even a museum like the __divine institution__ that we read about earlier could find ways to engage their visitors without tarnishing its aesthetic. Must there be a tradeoff between the two?
