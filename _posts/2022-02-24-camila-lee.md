Hi, I'm Camila!

I'm a senior at Wellesley College majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Korean Language and Culture. My past research experiences with the Wellesley College Human-Computer Interaction Lab and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Scheller Teacher Education Program have led me to design studies that seek to understand how to optimize learning with different model mediums such as immersive virtual reality. Furthermore, my past teaching experiences have brought valuable insights about instructional design and the learning experience to my education technology research. I'm particularly interested in researching the role of emotions in the process of learning, and I hope to design enjoyable learning experiences for students. In my free time, I like to journal at cute cafes, chat with my friends about random hypothetical situations, and put together playlists!
