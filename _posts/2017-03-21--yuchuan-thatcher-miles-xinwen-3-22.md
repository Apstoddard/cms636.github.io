### Proposal
We think it would be a great idea to sort all the locations not only by time, but by the activity and space type. Thus we can have a clear vision about what Melville is doing. And a heat map to show the frequent visit area.

Step1:
Sorting out the location by activity:  Arts, Church, Eating, Errands, Literary, Meeting, Passing Through, Sightseeing, Stop, Vehicle.
Sorting out the location by space: Bookstore, Birdge, Church, Court, Gallery, Hill, Park, Parks, Square, Station, Theater.

Step2:
Making map based on the category and Assigning every activity/space type different colors.

Step3:
Making a heat map
