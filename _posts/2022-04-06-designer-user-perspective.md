The introduction provides a comprehensive knowledge outline of how to design the ui ux experience. I am not familiar with ui design, but design has been a very powerful communicative medium, which I think more highly than art, for the “significant relationship between perceived aesthetic quality and perceived usability for a variety of culture…” I like to see design as a process where two sets of functionality and materiality/aesthetics travel separately, and design bridges the joint of collaboration that also makes sense semantically. But that is from a designer’s perspective. As an everyday user, my definition of good design is invisible, and only stands out when there is a malfunction or glitch.
