## Thoughts
It is suggested that digital archiving must be done on demand, essentially such that it "archives itself". The internet is described a new, dynamic type of archive: a "transarchive". Analog storage media is praised for having a higher quality and shelf life compared to digital. I thought it was interesting that it was suggested that some information or art might be transient and "instantaneous" in nature and thus shouldn't be archived. Archives in Transition explores how the aesthetics of storage are changing radically with digitization.
