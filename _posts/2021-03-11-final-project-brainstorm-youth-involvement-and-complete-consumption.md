title: 'Final Project Brainstorm: Youth Involvement and Complete Consumption'
author: Delace Jia

**Youth Over Yonder**
- The problem this project aims to address is the low participation of the youth in cultural experiences such as museums. The project would attempt to provide a resource where museums with discounted youth prices are collected in one area for students to reference.
- The envisioned audience for this project would be teenagers. Parents with younger children could also potentially use this project. 
- Potential museum collaborators would be ones with a very strong interest in youth engagement. Potentially the University museums where student prices and student participation are prominent. 
- The technological approach would include something similar to the Artbot methodology. A front-end website would allow users to log in and find museums and their youth admissions in the area. In the backend, the website would scrape museum websites in the area and return their youth prices. 
- Skills sets needed: Web design, Web scraping

**Complete Consumption**
- This project would attempt to address the issue of museum engagement and the longevity of an experience on an audience. This project would aim to create a more memorable experience by providing experiences that tangentially relate to details in a primary experience. A prominent example of this would be providing restaurants that have themes similar to museums exhibitions, or similar cultural backgrounds. 
- The envisioned audience for this project would be people who go to museums as a part of an outing rather than for the museum itself. Something like families or adults who have a ‘day trip’ just to go out, and do arrive at museums with the intention to fully connect with all of the objects inside. 
- Potential museum collaborators: Art museums, local restaurants?
- Technological approach: I imagined utilizing museum databases, artwork databases, and restaurant menus. These would either be accessed through finding a database or scraping websites. The restaurant menus on their website would be scraped. When a user submits a museum or exhibition that they visit, the project would look for keywords in the artwork description/artist background, and then match it with an experience nearby.
