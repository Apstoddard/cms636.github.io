Based on my observation, the website's functionality appears to be fairly straightforward and easy to use. Users can browse through the collection by clicking on the page numbers, and they can search for specific documents by entering keywords into the search bar. The website also provides filters to help users narrow down their search results. 
On the main page, the visitors of the website only get to see the title of the photographs, without insights into any further details. I personally really appreciate the intention behind this choice of interface design as it draws all the viewers' attention to the photography itself, and the viewers will solely make their choice of reading based on the visuality. 

When you click into the photograph, it shows you the list of basic information about the images. What I like about this interface is that there are no long paragraphs of description but only clickable key words that guide you to an additional page with extra  information, relevant works, and external resources such as youtube videos that can provide a more thorough explanation and description if needed. What I love the most about the functionality is the zoom-in & zoom-out options of the photograph. Especially for the ones with very small details and figures, zooming in gives you a more detailed depiction of the story in the photograph, allowing you to focus on only one or two objects or figures within a photo at a time. Although the photos are 2-D, the flow of zooming in and out, and positioning within the photo frame, were able to provide an immersive visiting experience as close to 3D as possible.
