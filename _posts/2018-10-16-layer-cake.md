## Layer Cake Critique

A layer cake is a unique way to display the events of someone's pilgrimage journey. However, this layer cake showcases Ibn Jubayr's travels in pretty concise way. Each event is portrayed both geographically and temporally. In addition to the portrayal of each event, there is an accompanied description and date of each event. Also, events are linked to photos of the locations that Ibn Jubayr explored. Events are separated by descriptors that give viewers an idea of the overall mood that Ibn Jubayr was in throughout his travels. This layer cake could be the beginning of a Surface/Depth view of Ibn Jubayr's travels. It could give a high level view of the major events happening during the time of his travels and show the juxtaposition between world events and Ibn's pilgrimage.
