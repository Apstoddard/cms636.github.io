title: Fluid Textuality and New Challenges
---

The "Augmented Editions and Fluid Textuality" section introduces the concept of fluid textuality in the Digital Humanities context. The digital works makes it easier than ever before to manipulate data, transform it into new forms, types and objects. Text can be copied and pasted, its visual representation can be changed by switching to a different typeface or color, it can be transformed into pictures, videos and sounds. The growing selection of open access works has made it simple to cut and mix other peoples' word, creating digital "collages".

While this fluidity has brought many new opportunities, both in creating texts and analyzing them using digital techniques, I believe it also comes with a lot of challenges. As the authorial identity starts shifting "from the age of the individual voice to that of the collaborative, collective, and aggregated voice of the fluid text", it's becoming increasingly difficult to judge texts in context - only because there usually just isn't a single context. The texts can be used by many different people of different backgrounds, beliefs, political optinions, eventually merging into a huge common, 'globalized' synthesis, and recovering its parts becomes just as difficult as analyzing the texts themselves.
