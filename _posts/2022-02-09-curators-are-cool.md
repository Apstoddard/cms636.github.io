## Response to "Enhanced Critical Curation" from Digital Humanities

I think this idea of “data processing” actually being a practice that dates computers is a nice comparison that actually serves to bridge the connection between human and tech. In a world where our technology is so powerful and advanced, levels of abstraction are needed for human interaction with it. It’s nice to sort of remember that these technological advancements all come from uniquely human instincts to process, connect with, and make sense of the world. 
I’ve sort of never really sat with the idea of one of the challenges of collection being that there will always be more things to collect. There is perhaps limited space in the literal sense (digitally for online materials and physically for objects) and also less time (less people?)  to do the needed processing of this information for it to be digestible. This really exemplifies the importance of and need for curators.
