**Alien Reading: Text Mining, Language Standardization, and the Humanities**

In this article, the author tries to point out the gap between human and machine reading, and let us know the complexity debate between the accuracy of text mining tools and the fact that scholars already depend on generative models and other text-mining techniques. The whole argument is reasonable and logical. First of all, the author illustrates the process of machine reading method which is different from human reading and acknowledged that the significance and necessity of text-mining under such big data background. And then he differentiated the characteristics of science articles and poetry which shows the text-mining is more suitable for science articles. Then he suggested that goes further into a critique of the technology itself, engaging with text-mining tools as embodied, historically situated cultural productions that are potentially problematic. In order to minimize this problem, he argued that “supplement our experimentation with text-mining methods with research that situates them historically—both in the short term, looking at the institutional contexts from which they emerged, and in the long term, looking at how they relate to the histories of linguistic thought, philosophy, communication, and labor organization.” 

The last part argument reminds me of the articles we read in several weeks ago. The content is that the time and space mapping has been over-simplified in GIS tool and some scholars have adopted this tool for their research for a longtime. It’s important to be wary of the limitation of our techniques and use critical perspective to adjust the expectation and result. Even though we are worried about the growing influence of these imperfect techniques in the twenty-first century, we should admit that the only way to improve this problem is to combine human thinking and machine learning rather than give up easily. 

The “non-figurative” poetry debate part also let me think about our project as pop music automation. Just as Sarah mentioned before the lyrics generated from python is not so appealing and beautiful, that could be the difference between our human reading and machine reading. 


**How We Read: Close, Hyper, Machine**

In the first part, the author illustrates the definition of close reading and points out the fact of close reading declining is just a result of trend transformation which isn’t equal to reading crisis. Also, the most important thing here is that the literature teaching should combine digital and print method together rather than separate them. The author argued that teaching should take place in the zone of proximal development and disciplinary shift to a broader sense of reading strategies and their interrelation should be addressed. 

Then she explained the concept of hyperreadng which stimulates a new concern about media-induced state of distraction. And she also gave the answer to the distraction question that it lies in the relation of working memory to long-term memory. The small distractions involved with hypertext and Web reading increase the cognitive load on working memory and thereby reduce the amount of new material it can hold. She also used several recent experiments to show that the web reading gives pressure to brain. 

Instead of using scientific analysis, the author believes that anecdotal evidence is more useful to understand the situation. She explored the interrelations between the components of an expanded repertoire of reading strategies that includes close, hyper, and machine reading, and found the overlaps between them are as revealing as the differences: Hyperreading overlaps with machine reading in identifying patterns. Then she realized that “close, hyper, and machine reading each have distinctive advantages and limitations; nevertheless, they also overlap and can be made to interact synergistically with one another.” Then she used several examples to show how to accomplish them. 

The immediate case came into my mind is the way our digital humanities class organized. In each week’s assignment, we would read two or three articles and connect the concepts with practicing a small project. The assignment not only requires us to read the new concepts and interact with digital tools, but also allows us to think about how to tell a story in digital format and how to improve the experience. This case is very similar to the first example Literature+.
