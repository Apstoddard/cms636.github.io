### Problem Statement:
Music can be an important indicator and influencer to cultural shift and movements. Being able to analyze the historical development of music across time and space can be a helpful resource in analyzing these trends. Rather then simply reading song names, being able to listen to the music would add an additional level of understanding.
### Approach:
In order to display both geographic and chronological trends, I propose a web site that shows the major cities for hip-hop development. A yearly timeline can be stepped through starting in 1970 until 2015. Selecting a city brings up a sampling of the music being created in that location at that time, as well as a description of the style. The music blurbs will be similar to those on: http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/

Thus audiences can track changes over time as well as changes from place to place, while listening to the movements as they occurr.
### Audience:
This website can be used for Hip-Hop aficionados looking to explore hip hop music or music historians looking to develop an understanding of trends across time and space.
### Skills needed:
Web-development, Database management
