I think Matthew Ericson has a good point here, though it is very similar to what others have expressed before: Any tool can be great in certain situations, and useless in others. What this text does is provide more concrete examples that elaborate on Bodenhamer's "The Potential of Spatial Humanities", showing both examples of when GIS is well used, and when other visualizations were more appropriate. Overall I liked the examples and agree with him.
