It was really interesting to look through this archive! There was a lot of variety in the types of photos through the different collections and within the collections themselves. The interface was relatively simple and easy to use, though I did see a few areas for improvement. First, I would love to be able to see more photos per page. I think I was only able to view around 40 photos on a page at a time and I would have loved to see more, especially since loading the next pages took a decent amount of time and there were a lot of pages. Also, I think it could be interesting to have sub-folders within the collections. A lot of the photos were of the same event from different angles while a lot of the photos seemed unrelated from one another, so I think it would be useful to either have further categorizations of the photos within the collections or to be able to group and categorize photos yourself as a viewer.
