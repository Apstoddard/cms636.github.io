Database Documentaries: 

A documentary can be useful in many ways to create an engaging story which provides a lot of insight and information to the audience. It allows the audience in some sense to understand it all from a certain perspective. However, the disadvantage is that this view is also limited in a way. It provides the audience with only the clips and scenes that a person, the director, decided was essential to show in order to piece the story together. Hence, you're missing out on a lot of other facts that could've been relevant. 

Database documentaries work much in the same way. You can have animation, sound, linkes, websites, film, or virtually anything to portray your data in such a stimulating way for the audience. However, it is still bounded within the limits of technology and perspectives. I guess you can say though that information/data has always been bounded within some walls in a certain way. Technology, on one hand, expands those bounds to allow the user to grasp so much more data than they could ever imagine. Yet, on the other hand, usually all of these sources are filtered in some sort of way. So I guess the real question is how do you bring all of the data together without letting any of it be lost in any way? How do you confer "unity upon such a variable experience" (pg 55). Thus is rather difficult and I don't think there is an answer to that just yet. However, the book does mention that in the meantime while we are trying to figure out that answer, let's appreciate the fact that having so many variable opinions, ideas, and perspectives is also a really good thing! It allows everybody to exchange thoughts on certain topics and allows for "imaginative expression"(pg.55) from individuals from all over the world.
