Receiving a rundown of how user testing is incorprated into a research project's life cycle outlines well how to ensure that certian design principles (whether determined by the creator or general best practices) remain present and prioritized in all phases of development. Feedback in the intermediate stages can provide a lot of information as to how the audience views the meaning and utility of an interface beyond the creator's conceptuatlization of extant semiotic vocabularies. Lastly, the point of design transferability, even if it is only a single component of the final assembly/result that may then be adapted for use in related or unrelated disciplines, stands out to me as one of the most exciting and impactful results of interface design.
