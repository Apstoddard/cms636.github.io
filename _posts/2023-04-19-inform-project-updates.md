- Initial designs and mock-ups

	- See slides for diagrams/images
	- Two computers can interact with the web server
		- These are representative of the consoles in the museum
		- Interact with inform by using mouse rather than kinect
		- Otherwise the same as the proposed solution
	- Web server holds internal state of inFORM system
		- Array of pixel locations on the inform
		- state is updated whenever an input computer manipulates the state on the inform
	- Output computer pulls new state in real time from server, displays what the inform would show

- Any other updates such as changes to the original concept, conversations with museum partners, etc
	- in contact with Debbie on what an exhibit with inFORM might look like at the MIT Museum, weâ€™re trying to get in touch with members of the Tangible Media Lab to understand the engineering aspects underneath the machine
- Questions or issues that you are struggling with
