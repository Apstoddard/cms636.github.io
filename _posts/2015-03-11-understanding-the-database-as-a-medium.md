In reading Manovich's Piece "The Database," I struggled in understanding how to use the Database as an artistic medium. Whether due to the prevalence of the narrative form or my own limited exposure to different artistic mediums, I could not separate the ideas conveyed in narrative and in what ways the database could be distinguished. The farthest I could comprehend was the database of narratives, which would still mimic the narrative form. I think the description of Dziga Vertov's work was extremely helpful for me to visualize what the database as a separate and distinct form of media could be. As a collection of effects, Vertov's __Catalogue__ manages to convey feelings and moods without the need for a narrative.

Considering __Catalogue__ forced me to reconsider what art and what storytelling is. I have watched avant-garde films but never thought how to catagorize them beyond an emotion. Additionally, I didn't ever consider that multiple of these feelings could be collected in a single work. Vertov's work demostrates that these single movements can be captured and shown in a collection and not just singly. I am excited to see how future artist embrace the concepts that can be developed by the database.
