This reading on the history of curation reminds me of how much challenges have been raised under the fact that collection-building and curation have remained constants of humanistic knowledge production. Especially moving on to the digital era, digital curators have to deal with a larger quantity of online content such as social media posts, videos, images, and articles across a wide variety of genres. They are responsible for selecting, categorizing, and creating series of collections that offer a specific perspective or focus. From my personal standpoint, sourcing and selecting within collections and documentions throughout thousands of years of history is indeed out of human capacity, suggesting an area where AI can take over and prevent the problem of data overload. AI can also reduce concerns over human manipulation in areas such as lack of standards, ethical considerations, as well as data privacy and security.
