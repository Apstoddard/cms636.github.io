-Why do you think the decisions to intentionally use collections from diverse backgrounds (gender, race, sexuality, etc) ultimately did not provide anything enlightening from the machine learning you were using? 
-What did you hope machine learning would pick up on or elucidate as far as connecting or explaining the sociological background of particular audios or videos?
- Do you think there are other Machine Learning services out there that could help you to accomplish this task? 
-Do you think there are additional types of data sources out there that would help machines create more relevant metadata? (Perhaps combining your collections with other types of stories or data relevant to them?)
