I like what this piece had to say because too often museums (or any institution trying to get people to participate) think that the most open-ended, free experience must be the best. Staring at a blank piece of paper makes me break out in a light sweat, so I appreciate the emphasis on constraining experiences for easier participation. 

I guess what I'm saying is that unlike most weeks, I don't really have a strong opinion to offer this week. I really agree with the idea that the best way to make participation is to limit scope. Game design is similar: if you do everything, while trying to appeal to everyone, you will make a horrible, boring game. Even Second Life, an MMO that lets you do lots of things, has a target audience of people who it appeals to, and they acknowledge that is not the entire world. The right answer to designing participatory experiences is finding the right balance of what the institution wants, what is possible for everyday people to create and what environment that creativity needs, and the value of showing those created assets to people in a way that gets them excited about the institution or what it is promoting.

Normally I write like four pages on these posts before I feel like I'm done, so it's a bit weird to be all out of things to say. Design is really important, as is scope, and knowing your audience. Doesn't take too long to agree with that.
