The authors of this paper believe that interface designer should focus on practical consequences of their design rather than the strict functional opportunities of the interface. 

They advocate for providing proper context for the collection items. The quote below is especially relevant for our museum work. Most museum visitors don’t enter the museum  searching for a specific piece.

> For people who are looking for a well-defined target document, search interfaces, based on more or less sophisticated retrieval engines, are a good solution. However, users looking for an understanding of an entire collection and how the various components comprising it interact are not well served by retrieval interfaces. The limitations of a retrieval interface become even more apparent when potentially useful information is available in the relationships between items.

Effective cultural heritage interfaces need to accommodate new and unfamiliar visitors. The authors discuss “rich prospect browsing” which is essentially a home page to show the breadth of all of the items in the collection and allow the user to narrow the scope of content. I am a proponent of this type of browsing for online archives. One of my favorite parts of visiting museums is entering a huge gallery and absorbing the enormity of the exhibit. There’s a thrill of intaking every possible corner to explore. Current websites don’t do the best job of showcasing the enormity of their collections. However a good example of highlighting ALL items in a collection is this [Google Arts and Culture explorer](https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/freefall/random#123.06,30.29,918.82).
