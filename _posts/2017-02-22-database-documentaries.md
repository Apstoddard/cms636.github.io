Here are a few examples of database documentaries (in reference to the same topic in section 2 of Digital_Humanities, pp. 54-55):

Work by Ian Flitman who calls them "adaptive media narratives": [http://www.blipstation.com](http://www.blipstation.com). Check out "Hackney Girl" for an early example.

An example for an educational German Studies/Cultural Studies interactive (database) doucmentary is "Berliner sehen", developed here at MIT. It was filmed in 1995 and has been online and used wihtout interuption since 1997. [Berliner sehen](http://berlinersehen.mit.edu).

There are plenty more, please add them if you find another good example.
