## How Deceptive are Deceptive Visualizations?

Deceptive Visualization effects can be classified as "message reversal" or "message exaggeration/understatement". The study classified these effects and then rendered synthetic examples to reproduce them in a controlled environment. Results showed that deceptive charts did indeed affect the way people interpret messages and that sometimes this occurs in accordance with people's personal traits/attributes.


I think the author brings up an interesting point when they say "not following best practices of visualization design, such as truncating the axes, may lead to a deceptive visualization either _with_ or _without_ intent, depending on the sophistication of the creator." The researcher is saying that those who do create deceptive vizualitions do it either with the intent to deceive or because they lack the skillset to appropriately convey their message through these visualizations. I appreciated that they clarified that while intent is a problem area, it is not the focus of deceptive visualizations. Instead, the focus should be prioritized to the way the message is received by the reader. 

"Almost all visualizations are prone to distortion or lie." I agree witht this point because people interpret messages very differently and as a result the visualization can be painted as a "distortion" or "lie". Also, there isn't a one for all distortion technique one can use. Different distortion techniques--such as color deception, truncated axes, and missing labels--are dependent on the type of data being visualized and the message being conveyed.
