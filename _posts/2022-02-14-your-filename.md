## The Experience Economy

This reading felt like mostly a reframing of "experiences" as a new type of commodity to sell. I'm not sure how I feel about that -- I'm not sure that profit-focused businesses are the best or most desirable model for museums to follow. I understand that, given the way our economy works, museums must necessarily make money so they can continue to exist; but incorporating that into their philosophy would seem to lead to flawed incentives. 

For instance, to discuss the first principle, I'm not sure a museum especially needs a theme, particularly not one of the ten listed here. Generally museums have a topic of focus -- art, science, history -- but that seems to lie more in the realm of the "domain" of a theme expressed here. The best museum exhibits bring us to question typical narratives and realize unexpected things. Part of what I feel is missing here is the concept of education. However, the notion of experiences as a combination of entertainment and engagement, I think, could be quite useful for thinking about how to design enjoyable exhibits.

On the other hand, the third principle of eliminating negative cues I believe is very relevant. At the MIT Museum we discussed the difficulties of positioning a museum in such an awkward building, never designed to be a museum to begin with. Hopefully the new building will feel friendlier and be easier to create exhibits for. 

Finally, the principle of engaging the senses seems most relevant to the planned exhibit of 19th century teaching physics equipment -- not just showing the instruments to people, but teaching them how the instruments work through allowing their use.

## First-time and Repeat Visitors

This study raises an important question: that of how to attract and retain visitors to museums. Its findings are kind of what I expected. Their profile indicated that visitors tend to be older, higher-income, more-educated women. I do wonder why repeat visitors are even likelier to be women. Without understanding why that's the case, it would be difficult to try to increase repeat visits by men, which is one of the study's proposals. The finding that visitors, who were largely satisfied and found that the museum met their expectations, rated low "excitement, fun, and entertainment" derived from their museum visit would seem to contradict the philosophy of our other reading.
