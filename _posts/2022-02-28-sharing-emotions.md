Title: Sharing Emotions 

Description: “How are other people experiencing the same piece of art that I am looking at? How do others feel when they see this art? What songs do they think of when they see this piece of art?”; these are the questions that inspired me to pursue this project. For my project, I want to create a platform for people to add songs or comments about how they feel when looking at a piece of art. This way, people can feel like they are part of a community of people at a museum.

Audience: People that want to experience art with others

Museum Collaborators: Getty, MFA

The Technological Approach: Add NFC tags near a piece of art that links to a shared Spotify playlist or a comment thread.

Skill Sets Needed: Knowledge of NFC tags, UX Design
