title: Disavowing Authorship or Stronger Identity?
author: Xinwen

It seems like there are two things that Macalik, Frasers, McKinley are expecting for curators. The first would be discursive curation - losing the full control of exhibition and letting visitors explore content to their own willing. The second thing is augmenting the interaction and creating immersive experience. I have to point out that sometimes this two could be the different aspect of one curation, however, sometimes immersive experience means stronger identity and authorship. Because the behavior of visitors is fully anticipated and designed by curator. Especially for AR and VR project in museum, their job is to react according to the audienceâ€™s reaction, thus they have to anticipate every possible behavior that audience have and sometimes lead them to experience.
