Sonification is analogous to our work with visualization and spatialization because all of these reincarnations of information speak to the fact that “data is fluid and not tethered to any sense.” I very much agree with this concept of data plasticity because I am hugely interested in diverse representations of thought. There is indeed a privileging of vision as the sense to provide scientific knowledge. 

In addition, the idea of transcoding made me think of tangible user interfaces in a completely new way. I want to explore auditory/sonic user interfaces (usually under ambient user interfaces). It would, as the text describes, capitalize on a person’s uninvolved ability to detect pattern and anomaly. I would love to explore how it could be used it STEM in schools (having students hear the yeast cells to understand what the organisms do). I am actually imagining object oriented programming done in an auditory way (what would recursion or a for loop sound like).  

This article ties in closely to a conversation I was having with my mother about my career. I am finding that my interests are in new ways of allowing diverse representations and interpretations of thought for all types of learning. However, my focus is not classroom learning approaches, but creating / using technologies in new and practical ways that faciliate all types of learning. I wonder if there are studies that tie together sonification and embodied cognition. I believe those two would be an incredibly powerful combination.
