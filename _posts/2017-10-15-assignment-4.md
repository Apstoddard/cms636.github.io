**Time in Print**
Gerardus Mercator, astronomers, historians and cartographer, collected astronomical evidence-records of dated eclipses and other celestial events mentioned by ancient and medieval historians. By doing so, the historians and scholars could get better understanding of these recorded events in dates and hours, which provide more detailed information for research. The beauty of this method is that it can combines astronomy and geography information together to present a comparatively real setting. 
Joseph Priestely's Chart of Biography in 1765 also gave us visual understanding of the peak when most famous historical figures were active( which is also useful and frequent used in today) and the general compare between each period. Even though it has the limitation in linear timeline format, but its clarity and power is valuable. 

**Spatial Humanities**
In this article, the author first analyzed the contemporary concept of space which based on time. And then he illustrated that space could give different countries different characters. And there are a lot of debates between GIS critics and defenders. The former criticized that the world could not be measured so precisely and GIS does not accept uncertainty. While the defenders think that although there might be different understanding about one object, the object itself is independently existed. Then the author talks about the development of GIS and its advantages as well as the limitations. The following part he demonstrates the definition of deep map and the great scenarios when GIS mapping could associated with other technologies perfectly in representing experience and history. In the final part, he thinks its our responsibility to pursue it.
I appreciate the effort that the author tries to explaining the spatial idea from ontology and epistemology perspective. I find it is interesting because usually when we start touch a new software, we prefer to learn the different functions as soon as possible rather than trying to learn the deep intention and value of the software critically. After reading it, I might start to think what's the limitation of the software and how can I improve it. For the final goal of the author, I think the idea is just similar to other digital humanity topics which pursue combining all the technologies together. In a word, representing past, now and future. 

**Emerging Methods**
1. Big Data: In order to deal with macro data sets and make it valuable for humans, we will have to design and employ new tools to analyze, visualize, map, and evaluate the deluge of data and cultural material that the digital age has unleashed: tasks that will require humanists to contend with text-mining tools, machine reading, and various kinds of algorithmic analyses.
2. Game: Even though the reputation of Gaming is not as high as academia, the high user engagement in digital humanity could build a virtual learning environment for educational purpose.
