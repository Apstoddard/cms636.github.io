Hi! I'm Zygi, a junior at MIT studying Computer Science and Engineering. I'm interested in game design, political science and their intersection - exploring governance and player interaction in virtual worlds. I'm excited to learn more about the ideas and frameworks of digital humanities and apply them in my hobby projects.
