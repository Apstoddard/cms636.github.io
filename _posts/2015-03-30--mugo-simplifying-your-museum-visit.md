Project Title: [MuGo] Museum Trip Planner;”Easy, Breezy, Art”-MuGo 

Problem: Often times you go out of your way to visit a museum, one may not be familiar with the area, amenities, and services offered by the museum. In fact, people may chose not to go to a museum because they feel like they will encounter inconveniences such as transportation, weather, and food issues. Another issue, is that people often feel that the information displayed in a museum is removed from one’s common knowledge and they may feel overwhelmed going to a museum. While there are applications that can provide such information, we aim to provide such information in a compiled, helpful manner. 

Approach: We would like to streamline and concentrate the information in an interface that is easy to navigate and user friendly. One would be able to chose a museum and the date in which they hope to visit the museum. In response, the interface will display the weather for the day, tour times, museum events, transportation routes and travel time, and ratings of local restaurants and coffee shops near the museum. This way museum visits become less daunting and more feasible to the general public.

Audience: Our app targets a broad audience. We imagine our persona anywhere from young adult onwards. We hope that socioeconomic status will not be a limiting factor, however, our persona is most likely a more educated group;those who want to frequent museums, but don’t have time to plan out trips. Additionally, this app would prove useful to tourists and new residents of a given area.
