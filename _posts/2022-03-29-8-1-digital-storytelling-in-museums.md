This paper makes 2 major points. 

First, people are changing how they consume content. They use social media and search engines that readily feed them sugary information whenever they please. If museums want to stay relevant, they have to make their stories and exhibits appealing. The paper makes the point that when exhibits use outdated technology, the visitors assume the material is outdated as well.

Second, to mitigate this issue of outdatedness, museums have been jumping at adding new technology to exhibits. However, the authors pose the following question, “In the evolving question of the triangular relationship between the media, the space, and the visitor, how does the addition of a layer of immersive media add to or detract from the spatial effects of a particular gallery?” They then provide a concrete list of strategic and tactical thoughts for navigating this concern. They have an overarching mission statement that curators should ask core questions about the goal of the exhibit before jumping in to adding techbology.
