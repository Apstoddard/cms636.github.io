Rachel is a third year MIT undergraduate studying Art and Design in the School of Architecture and Planning. She is mainly interested in user experience, user interface design, and human computer interaction. Her experience in HCI comes from interning at an HCI laboratory (KIXLAB) at KAIST, UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program) work at the d'Arbeloff Laboratory at MIT, and past coursework in both computer science and design. When she is not working, she enjoys dancing as part of MIT Asian Dance Team.
