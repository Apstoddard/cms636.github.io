In this article, Wolfgang takes Europeana as an example to illustrate on how new archives respond to current needs rather than just being a read-only memory or Data backups, which responds to their behavior. For now, what we try to do is to archive the traditional art. While new media art nowadays also gives more attention on interaction between audience and the artwork. I wonder what would happen several decades later when we begin to archive new media art which itself could already be interactive with users. Take team lab as an example, most of Its artworks change based on the presence or behavior of viewers. When we archive them, how can we use an interactive way to capture the enhancement of this exaggerated user-experience? Maybe at that time, the filters on a digital archive's website are not only limited to color, sound, text..but also the amount of participating users at that time, usersâ€™ age distribution, average time they spent interacting with this artifact etc.
