title: 'Project Pitch: The Virtual Freedom Trail'
author: Parker Greene
---
(2 versions - AR and VR)

## Augmented Reality:
_Idea:_ A smartphone app tracks your location as you navigate the trail and can help you relocate it if you lose the trail. If you point it at a building/landmark along the trail, you can see historical information about it.The freedom trail can be difficult to navigate, especially for tourists that aren’t familiar with Boston. They don’t know which landmarks are nearby or what they’re looking at most of the time
_Audience:_ tourists, locals that haven’t been on the trail
_Platform:_ smartphones



## Virtual Reality:
_Idea:_ Create a virtual space in which users can explore the freedom trail and interact with the landmarks around it. It would be very similar to the AR experience, but instead the users are in a completely virtual world. This would be ideal for people to experience the history of Boston along the trail without actually having to be on the trial
_Audience:_ amateur history buffs, tourists that can’t travel/don’t want to spend the money to come to Boston
_Platform:_ VR headset experience (Rift, Vive, Google Cardboard, etc)
