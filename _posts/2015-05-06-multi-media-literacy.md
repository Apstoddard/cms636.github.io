This article seems to advocate for two changes in classroom curricula: the expansion of cultural artifacts used in the classroom and the expansion of media types used in assignments.

For the first, the author argues for the introduction of popular culture and Internet and other digital technologies into the classroom. In the case of Moby Dick, the author invites educators to use popular culture transmedia examples to show the spread and remix manifestations of the novel. However, I feel that there is more to reading novels than this study of a book's impact. On a different level, reading books-- especially old books-- reveals aspects of the human condition that exist today. It shows the reader that others have experienced similar trials and emotions to one's own. This aspect can be especially useful to young people, who are rapidly learning how to exist more independently in the world. I do not want to see this aspect of (old) book reading lost in the hype surrounding technology. 

However, I remember one assignment from high school that incorporated pop culture well. We were studying poetry in my freshman English class, and, after discussing and dissecting several poems from the canon, we were asked to pick a song and write about the poetic style and metaphor used in the lyrics. In another class, called "Search for Identity," our final project was an identity book, a scrapbook that included ten one-page essays describing different aspects of our identities. These assignments did not detract from the traditional curriculum, but, rather, enhanced it by connecting it to our lives and current media practices.

For the second change, the author argues for designing assignments of a broader range of media types. For example, instead of writing a paper, students could write blog posts, then read and comment on others' work. This method of incorporating technology has proven successful in several of my college-level classes. Other examples are more creative, such as songwriting or digital games.

My high school teachers incorporated this slightly less well, as I do not remember having any assignments besides traditional writing.

However, I would like to propose a third change classrooms could incorporate: travel. I am not saying all classes should travel abroad or anything, as that is inaccessible to most, but immersive activities (like field trips) can greatly enhance the learning experience. These are also more accessible multimedia incorporations for those educators who are not so tech-savvy.

In the transcendentalist section of my AP Literature class, for example, we traveled to a local park to read and write poetry in a natural setting. After studying these artists who were inspired by nature inside the walls of the classroom for so long, it was very nice to change our setting and immerse ourselves in the topic in the setting on which transcendentalism was based. Other good examples include trips to museums or to see films or plays.
