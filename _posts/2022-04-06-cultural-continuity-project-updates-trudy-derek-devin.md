Here are some of our Project Updates

We took some of the feedback we got at our project presentation and decided to go with a more physical exhibition for the final project. This will involve recreating East Campus hallways through the use of projection. We decided to make this shift for a number of reasons. The first is that by recreating some hallways, we will be able to give the visitors to our exhibit a greater sense of what being in East Campus felt like. Through this, they may be able to understand better how the architecture and design of the space could give way to a culture that values creativity, community, and personal freedom. We also thought that using projection might allow for interactions that are more engaging and relevant, such as the ability to interact with the walls and create murals. We think it would be cool to have a feature that would allow past or future residents to annotate murals with stories or memories. Finally, we discussed having an audio component that involved conversations of individuals in East Campus, to really add to the collegial feel of the exhibit and give it a more personal feel. EC halls are rarely empty, and even if someone visits this exhibit by themselves they should have the sense that they are in good company.
