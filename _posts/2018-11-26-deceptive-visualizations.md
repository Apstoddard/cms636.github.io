This paper discusses how data visualizations can be deceptive. Such data is presented in a distorted or exaggerated way causing the user to believe a different story than the real one. The study presented in the paper showed that a significant portion of the participants got tricked by the graphs. I have seen a lot of the techniques, such as distorting the axis, on the television, which plays a large role in manipulating people into believing something that may be true or not. The power from such manipulations comes from the fact that most of the population do not spend time analyzing a graph. They just look at the visuals to notice a trend, size difference, or steepness in lines and get a clear message from it rather quickly. The study was not able to provide with a definite answer to the correlation between individual cognitive abilities and the individual getting tricked. Even though this probably plays a large role, many smart people read a graph fast and do not spend time deeply analyzing both axis, checking the scale factors, etc. In a fast paced world, simple deceptive visualizations can even fool the smartest individuals.
