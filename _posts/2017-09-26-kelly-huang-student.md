Hi everyone, I'm Kelly, a senior majoring in Economics at Wellesley College. Having been curious about the various and new ways knowledge and data can be presented, especially after taking courses in sociology, education and economics, I hope to explore this subject further through the course. With interests in exhibitions and theater, I am particularly looking forward to the topics: data visualization, curation, and spatial design.
