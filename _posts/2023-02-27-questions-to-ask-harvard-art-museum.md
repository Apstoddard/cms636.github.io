### Questions to ask:


- In what ways has the Harvard Art Museums engaged with communities of origin to discuss the display and interpretation of cultural artifacts in its collections?

- How does the museum ensure that its collections do not perpetuate power imbalances and colonial narratives?

- How does the museum's approach to restitution and repatriation align with the principles of the Reframe Initiative?

- Could you give examples of art in the museum's collection that have been identified as stolen or plundered? How has the museum addressed these issues?

- How does the Reframe Initiative intersect with other decolonization efforts in museums and cultural institutions, both within Harvard and more broadly in the cultural heritage sector?
