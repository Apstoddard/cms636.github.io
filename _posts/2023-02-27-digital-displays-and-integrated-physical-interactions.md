title: digital displays and integrated physical interactions
author: Tiffany Louie
---
## A description of the issue/problem that you are trying to address
- Many museums are moving towards a digital display approach where visitors interact with screens that can show a huge variety of information. However, this experience can be widely easily repeated on a laptop, so how can exhibits distinguish their digital displays from this. One approach is to simply have larger screens (ie: projection, theater style settings, LED displays) but that is a flat 2d experience. Additionally, if this breaks down, there is a large obstruction in the exhibit that offers no additional value for the visitor.
- How do we integrate technology into exhibits in a way that can add value, but if taken offline, does not actively subtract from the experience?
- Hardware integration into museums that are nonspecific (ie: can be modular and adapted in many ways to different exhibits that has the same flexibility that screens will have)
- How can we keep physical engagement in the center of a museum's experience

- Has a series of integrated science exhibits that can appeal to both adults and children. Displays with a highly technological backing that demonstrates core concepts in the physical world
- Mirrors, LED, massive human scale turntables with the solar system, friction slides, and other builds
- _MIT Museum, Terraform display_ (The one with blocks and sand, with a projection)
- _Lascaux IV_ Remaking and displaying the caves with current technology, allowing people to touch extracted models from the cave
- Tactile (or even textile) sensing and actuation technology from CDFG in CSAIL

## The envisioned audience for your project
First time and repeat museum visitors
Accessibility target- interacting with new technology in ways other than screens

## Potential museum collaborators (currently MFA; Harvard Art Museums, MIT-Museum, and others are possible as well)
MIT museum (as a starting point), moving into future exhibition designs

## Technological/spatial/installation approach (if part of the project)
A technological demonstration of modular displays or supporting technology to current exhibitions

## Skill sets needed for your project
Curation, pedagogical design, hardware and workshopping/prototyping
