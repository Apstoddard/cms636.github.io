## Enhanced Critical Curation

In the pre-digital age, information is scarce and to accumulate as much information as possible is always considered good. Compared to the pre-digital age, curators today face the opposite problem –– there is too much information, and the problem lies more in finding ways to organize the information. The article mentions "poetic composition as a compression algorithm and audience reception as a decompression tool"; however, the overload of information today means that the compression is not lossless, and what is discarded as part of the collection might gradually fade into obscruity. At the same time, what is chosen as being displayed might be too limited or subjective to show the audience the full picture. In conclusion, the question of choosing what to display versus what to omit can be a tricky problem.
