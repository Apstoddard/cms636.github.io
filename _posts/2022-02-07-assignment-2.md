## "What is a Museum?" Commentary

The author provides many details about museums from the origins of museums to how they evolved into what they are in the modern world. It is interesting how museums continue to be around for so long without changing a lot. In general, museums seem to be a place to observe and admire objects or exhibits that show something we do not really see in our everyday lives, such as paintings created centuries ago or sculptures of gods people worshipped in the past. The museums in the United States seemed to have always been some sort of source of education for children and continue to be one to this day. While I am not very familiar with museums in other countries, in the United States, museums are always shown to be an exciting place to learn about the world in both books and movies. I also did not realize how some museums started off quite small with just someone’s collection of what they found interesting before eventually growing into a larger museum. The support a museum receives was something I had always been curious about. While it is understandable that the support may depend on the popularity of the museum, it’s rather unbeneficial to the smaller museums that have either been around for a while or are just starting out. Throughout the article, it seems like everyone has their own opinion on what should or should not be considered a museum.
