A few thoughts on the readings:
1. It's suprising to me that the first instinct for people would be to develop a humanoid robot to interact with visitors -- seems very gimmicky. Would be curious to hear how the Smithsonian experiment ended. 

CUsueum:
THe vitualization of the industry (such as remote visits) suprised me -- I didn't expect musuems to be able to successfully virtualize, and having seen other virtual items I wonder which visitors prefer this -- is this school groups?

Also interesting was the part on cybersec in the Cusuem article -- it really seems lkike they';re fishing at straws. Most of the data breaches that account for their numbers involve medical data or high-priced PII, along with people who are willing to pay and have money to spend.
