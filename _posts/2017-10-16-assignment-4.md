**Reading 1: Cartographies of Time**
Daniel and Anthony spoke highly of 'The Minard Map'which has been raised once before in one of the lectures about data visualization as a classic example, but only the way of displaying the points where Napoleon’s troops divide into subgroups by breaking out the main bar into branches was mentioned back then.Taking a closer look at this diagram, more interesting findings were discoverred this time.This statistic chart is more of a temporal-spatial diagram rather than a geographical map although the actual rivers are marked.These rivers do indicate the geography information of the event but more importantly, they mark significant changes in number of troops, which in a way indicates possible battles between French and Russian armies[Fig.1].

The points where the troop number changes also related to the temperature chart, and the diagram is also able to show the drastic loss in life from Napoleon’s decision in just a single corner of the diagram[Fig.2].

I think what make this visualization so good is that it employs the geometries in a story telling fashion and unites temporal and spatial information with the geometry.

**Reading 2: The Potential of Spatial Humanities**
Advantages of GIS:
1 Great capability to manipulate large data sets and visualize the result of spatial analysis.
2 Provide accurate and optimized solutions whose relevent calculations is beyond human capability.
Disadvantages:
1 GIS employs a linear logic that is not adequate for understanding social complexity.
2 So heavily accurate data based that is not flexible to tackle ambiguity and uncertainty.
