Hi all! I'm a second-year urban design student in Harvard Graduate School of Design and also have a background at architecture. For this semester, I want to learn big data and visualization technologies to help with researching urbanization issues occurred in developing countries like China. Since I have already practiced graphic design for a long time, I would like to learn more relevant tools like programming and logistic thinking in this course.
