## "Introduction to Rich-Prospect Interfaces," S. Ruecker, M. Radzikowska, S. Sinclair

  I thought the question posed of "if you are... interested in finding out if any of the stairs creak, how many participants do you need to walk up the stairs?" was an interesting way to think about experimental design and prototyping technology. In the case of the audio exhibit, it would be interesting to adjust the permanent audio based on what audiences seem to be more interested in and change out topics based on what seems to group more naturally together. Allowing for an iterative design of the functional exhibit could greatly increase the likelyhood of engagement but also of returning engagers to view new iterations. Additionally, making sure that the user interface (rich-prospect browsing) in terms of our RFID's (not necessarily in home screens) will be important to have a clear & streamlines exhibit.
