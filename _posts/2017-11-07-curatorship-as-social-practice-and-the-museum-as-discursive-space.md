I very much agree with Kreps' proposal that curation is a form of social practice. I could really relate to the idea because I went to on a trip to the MFA for a class last fall on Islamic Archiceture and it was lead by the curator of the exhibit. At the time, I thought it was weird that the curator was guiding us through and explaining why she chose to display the pieces she did, but having read these two articles, it makes sense in reterospect.
I also thought it was interesting that "curator" is derived from a latin word meaning "to take care of" and that using this definition, the term curator can be expanded to include other individuals such as spiritual leaders. In fact, I think it would be interesting to think of teachers as curators of knowledge, not just as creators of educational programs as Kreps described them because a very important aspect of teaching is to carefully choose topics that are appropriate for students of certain age groups and will acomplish certain goals. For example, if an elementary school teacher wanted to teach algebra, he/she would do so using materials catered to elementary school aged students, not high schoolers.
