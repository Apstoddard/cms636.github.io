### CHRISTINA KREPS--Curatorship as Social Practice

According to Christina, the role of curators has been expanding significantly from merely  caretakeer of the object to an educator, interpretor and designer of the exhibitions and experience of the visitors. It's getting harder to clearly define what exactly a curator is, their work is also highly multi-faceted.

This changing role of curator is only part of a bigger shifting in the whole museum world during the past decades--the shifting significance from object-oriented space to visitor-oriented space. "The problem of decontextualization has been especially acute in the traditional object-centered museum in which objects and collections have served as the core around which all museum activities revolve." In this sense, in the museum context, objects are presented to visitors, not simply as artifacts, but as objects embedded in cultural significance. If one of museumsâ€™ main tasks consists in the contextualization of objects in their cultural meanings, past and present, museums may be cast anew, theoretically, as spaces not simply responsible for the preservation of artifacts, but as spaces of education as well.

I agree with Christina's insight of the changing role of curator and museum. Objects without any context are meaningless;Mere textual introductions of theme and metadata of the objects are far from enough to contextulize those objects and eventually too boring to raise visitors' interests, let alone trigger further debates.This is where new media and digital tools can set foot in, but only rely on the careful curation. 

### MACALIK et al--Introduction to the Special Issue: Discursive Space

Although Christina didn't give concrete example of how curation should work according to her theory,we can get a hint from her discussion about decontextualization of object that she is looking for proper design and storytelling to restore the lost context. The objects are used for stories, not that stories are used for objects. WHile Macalik et al propsed another approach where the role of a curator is less dominant, they should curate to create implicit and ambiguity to sparkle debate and negotiation among visitors rather than giving an explicit context and story. For me,Macalik's approach makes sense in terms of enpowering more freedom and democracy to the pubilc, in this way more objectivity and less dictates from the curator can be provided.

### Example--Berlin Jewish Museum

Among all the museums I've visited, the Berlin Jewish Museum is the most extrordinary one. The objects in the museum are no more than ordinary photographs,drawings, maps, but the experience of the building space re-contextualize these objects so well. The building space and elements arre closely related to the historical and social aspects of German-Jewish history. It was interesting that the objects hadn't been moved into the building until several years later after the building was first opened to the public and made great success.Here the building itself serves as the grand object narrating the stories, the architect was at some point acting as a curator and proved that the traditional object centered museum space can be shifted towards an experience(visitor) centered fashion.
