### CHRISTINA KREPS--Curatorship as Social Practice

According to Christina, the role of curators has been expanding significantly from merely  caretakeer of the object to an educator, interpretor and designer of the exhibitions and experience of the visitors. It's getting harder to clearly define what exactly a curator is, their work is also highly multi-faceted.

This changing role of curator is only part of a bigger shifting in the whole museum world during the past decades--the shifting significance from object-oriented space to visitor-oriented space. "The problem of decontextualization has been especially acute in the traditional object-centered museum in which objects and collections have served as the core around which all museum activities revolve." In this sense, in the museum context, objects are presented to visitors, not simply as artifacts, but as objects embedded in cultural significance. If one of museumsâ€™ main tasks consists in the contextualization of objects in their cultural meanings, past and present, museums may be cast anew, theoretically, as spaces not simply responsible for the preservation of artifacts, but as spaces of education as well.

I agree with Christina's insight of the changing role of curator and museum. Objects without any context are meaningless;Mere textual introductions of theme and metadata of the objects are far from enough to contextulize those objects and eventually too boring to raise visitors' interests, let alone trigger further debates.This is where new media and digital tools can set foot in, but only rely on the careful curation. 

### MACALIK et al--Introduction to the Special Issue: Discursive Space

Although Christina didn't give concrete example of how curation should work according to her theory,we can get a hint from her discussion about decontextualization of object that she is looking for proper design and storytelling to restore the lost context. WHile Macalik et al propsed another approach where the role of a curator is less dominant, they should curate to create implicit and ambiguity to sparkle debate and negotiation among visitors rather than giving an explicit context and story.
