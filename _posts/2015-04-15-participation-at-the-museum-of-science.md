Much like Zach, I couldn't find much that I disagreed with in Simon's text. The points made about participation are sound, especially the idea of using constraints as structure and the idea of encouraging social interaction by starting at the individual first.

The paper reminded me of a participatory experience I saw at the Museum of Science when I visited a few weeks ago. The museum had a small "engineering workshop" geared towards childen. It was a booth surrounded by tables with various mechanical/electronic parts on them. Within the booth, there were a number of contraptions that previous participants had built.

Childen would approach the booth and museum workers would encourage them to try their hand at building a contraption to achieve a particular goal. For instance, when I was there, I saw children building small windmills. The children would be guided for some time by the museum worker and before long, they were socializing with each other as they built their contraptions. WHen they were finished, their piece was put up on display in the booth.

Looking back, this had all elements of a great participatory experience. Since the children could see the other contraptions
