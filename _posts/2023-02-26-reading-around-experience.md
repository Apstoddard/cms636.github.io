In the reading “The Experience Economy”, I am particularly intrigued by the interpretation of experience in two dimensions: Participation and Connection. The article expands on the two dimensions by categorizing participation into passive and active, and categorizing connection into absorption and immersive. I think a successful experience should include options for both types of interaction, considering the differences among individual preferences. For example, an introvert might prefer to be a quiet observer while an extrovert might have a strong incentive to be a part of the show. By addressing the options of expected experiences to the visitors beforehand, the curators can better ensure the satisfaction of the visitors. At the beginning of the reading, the author used food and dining as an example of entertainment, which I found very interesting. There are many real life dining entertainment examples that can be used to support the author’s claim. 
Passive Participation Experience: 
At the Osteria Francescana restaurant in Modena, Italy, Chef Massimo Bottura creates a luxurious and relaxed atmosphere for his customers. The restaurant has a beautiful ambiance, with dim lighting, comfortable seating, and beautiful decor. The focus is on the food, but the overall dining experience is also a significant part of the meal.
The Rainforest Cafe is a popular chain restaurant that creates a unique ambiance by simulating a tropical rainforest. The restaurant has animatronic animals, waterfalls, and lush vegetation, providing customers with an immersive experience.
Active Participation Experience: 
At Genji, a sushi restaurant located in New York City, customers can participate in creating their meals. The restaurant offers a sushi-making class where customers can select ingredients and watch the chef prepare them. This type of dining experience creates a connection between the customer and the food they are eating, making the experience more meaningful.
The Melting Pot is a fondue restaurant chain that offers an interactive dining experience. Customers can select their fondue pot and dip their food into the cheese or chocolate fondue. This type of dining experience encourages customers to engage with their surroundings and creates a memorable experience.

In the reading “First-time and repeat visitors: What makes a satisfying museum experience”, I am curious whether the results from the group of repeat visitors can be misleading due to the selection bias. Those who choose to return to the museums already show that their first visit is satisfying and they are willing to recommend the museum to others, which can be seen through visiting as a group or family. Additionally, the reading suggests that there is huge potential for increasing the number of male repeat visitors since the majority of repeat visitors are female. I am curious whether gender plays a role in our interest in museums. If females are generally more interested in museums, wouldn’t it make more sense to first contribute more efforts to continue expanding the market of female visitors?
