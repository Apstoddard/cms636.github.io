I think that the greatest application computer science can have to the humanities is to deal with the problems of scale. As someone attempts to understand the vast amount of data from Internet source, that data must be collected, sorted and treated differently depending on its content or else there would be no way to understand it. If Twitter did not have the metadata of hashtags or other content-specific tags there would be no chance for someone to make sense of the data being produced. This mass of data can be used to produce art, conduct sociological studies, and provide useful information to end users from desired searches. 

The change from traditional humanities is not just the quantity, but the applications. As scholars used to curate exhibitions or annotate critical editions of texts, now digital humanities can provide a method for interesting information to be extracted from enormous amounts of data. If we want to discover the most common times for breakups, for example, we can scrape Facebook for relationship status changes to see what factors over the course of the year affect these numbers. Correlations (though not necessarily strong connections) can be made by utilizing data that was otherwise only avaiable through self-reported studies. The ability of a researcher to find data on relationships, posts on a specific topic, or even positive and negative opinions of events by automated search allows for not only the study of the basic texts online but the generation of more interesting data from that base material.

By converting the mass of data into relationships or visualizations, we take something insurmountable by human research and change it to a readable, interesting, and engaging exploration of something bigger than the original texts (or other data) that were used. Without computer science and the use of digital techniques on the humanities, this interesting meta-analysis of data would be impossible.
