One of the most interesting points made by the article was the evolving relationship between architects and augmenting space technology. The author gives examples of how architects are redesigning their spaces to allow technology to work with them. The author shows how one architect followed a more radical approach with his spaces and how he integrates technologies such as computer controlled lights. He eliminates all straight surfaces and angles. This can be very important since technology used to augment spaces can greatly benefit from easily mutable spaces. This added variability aligns with how data in the augmented spaces can be constantly changing in time and space. I believe many museums can learn from this in how they design their spaces since if they make them too fixed it can hinder future creativity within them. Now thinking about the MFA after reading this paper I can think of some areas in the museum that seemed like they would never change, one example I remember was a curved slim pathway with paintings on the curved walls. The nature of it being curved and narrow makes it impossible to change and since not many people fit through it one cannot do much with it apart from sticking art on the walls.
