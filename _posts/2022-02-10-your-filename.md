## Enhanced Critical Curation

I'm not very familiar with the "inventories" that were mentioned from Greek plays and poems, but I'm intrigued by the concept of "data compression as performance" and how that might relate the concept of curiosity cabinets as transformations, and then how both of those relate to modern museums. It sounds like "data compression as performance" puts more emphasis on audience interpretation, while curiosity cabinets put more emphasis on the collector's storytelling. The modern curator described in this text feels like a descendant of both: they choose some objects from an overwhelmingly large collection, and present them alongside some interpretative tools to guide the audience's understanding of the potential stories told by the objects. The work of interpretation and decompression becomes so large that the curator and the audience must share it. From this perspective, audience interaction isn't just a democratic ideal, but rather is a crucial component in realizing the potential of a curated collection.
