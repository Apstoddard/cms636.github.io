## Storytelling and Exhibitions beyond the physical object

- Do the recast objects require any specific maintenance or are they recast again if they are damaged?
- Do people believe they are real at first or are they informed beforehand about the objects being recast? If they are not, what are their reactions?
- Are there any changes being considered about the current way objects are being recast?
