Over the long weekend, we examined the material we found on the Philippine diaspora to include as a deep dive into Tagalog. A screenshot of bullet notes on relevant information we found and may want to include is included below. This information includes statistics about the Filipino community in the US which would help set the context for examining any trends, as well as interesting facts regarding the diaspora specifically, such as the level of effort that the Philippines has committed to supporting the diaspora to the US.

We are also in the process of exploring QGIS more to see what kind of trends can be found using the tool.
