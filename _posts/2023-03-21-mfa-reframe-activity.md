The selected reframe object is Nishida Junâ€™s ZETSU #8. The two reframe ideas are centered around the location of written description and the emphasis on the design process. 

At the moment, the objects are located in the center of the room,enclosed by glass boxes, whereas the written description is on the surrounding walls about seven to ten feets away. From our experience, having descriptions of exhibits far away from the objects can have a negative impact on the visitors' experience in a museum for several reasons. The first reason is the lack of context. When the description is far away from the object, visitors may have a hard time connecting the two. They may have to spend more time searching for the description, which can be frustrating and distract from the overall experience. This lack of context can also make it harder for visitors to understand the significance of the object.The second reason is the cognitive load. When visitors have to go back and forth between the object and the description, it can increase their cognitive load. This means that they have to work harder to process the information, which can be mentally exhausting and may reduce the amount of information they retain. Having the description far away can also result in disrupting flow. When descriptions are located far away from the objects, it can disrupt the flow of the museum experience. Visitors may have to backtrack or go out of their way to read the description, which can disrupt the overall narrative of the exhibition. Therefore, our proposed reframe is to implement augmented reality with audio reinforcement at locations closer to the objects. 

The second reframe idea is to expand the description of the design process. As for now, the description only includes the production phase of the object. We believe that touching on the design phase, such as how the designer twists the modules, thinks about the different possibilities, and eventually ends up with the selected object, can be very helpful for the user experience. First, it will enhance the visitor's understanding. By including the design process, visitors will gain a deeper understanding of how the object was created and the thinking behind its creation. This will make it easier for visitors to appreciate the object's design and functionality. In addition, understanding the design process can provide context for the object's creation. Visitors can gain insight into the social, cultural, and historical factors that influenced the design process. The design process can also showcase the designer's creativity and problem-solving skills. By sharing the design process, visitors can better appreciate the designer's contribution to the creation of the object, engage in the exhibition more actively and ask questions about the object's design, and learn about the different steps involved in the design process and the role of design in shaping the world around us.
