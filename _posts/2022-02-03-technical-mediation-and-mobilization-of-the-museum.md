## A New Post
This week’s reading touches on topics of technical mediation, architectural agency, inclusive design, civic participation, the hybridity of civic engagement, that provoke conversations in ways of reinforcement and/or contradiction. 

**Lascaux+IV: technological enablement; reproduction; architectural integration & hyper curation**
The Lascaux’s approach toward conservation and conversation fit into my imagination of museology * digitalization, however this digital clone raises the question of art reproduction and the loss of “aura” (Walter Benjamin). Not arguing against digitalization, I am curious about how you all think about the absence of physicality (caveness and materiality) and reality (even though they have been emphasizing the precision and identicality of the digital clone with the cave itself, I’m here raising a counter argument of technical restriction).

The visiting experience is highly curated from the pre-digested reinterpretation of cave specificity, visiting time, and most prominently the architecture circulation. The architect-curator partnership conditioned the integration of the landscape context (diagram in p132), visiting experience and the curatorial imagination: there are moments of deliberate deprivation of reality as a metaphorical cave experience; circulation and rhythm of the building denote intentional contemplation and understanding moments.
I felt that a comparison of this deliberation and general museum architecture could be interesting.

**Rozan-Museums at 2040, Simon’s Participatory Museum: social agency, design nuances**
Museums are functioning as civic institutions in mediating life. First and foremost I would like to bring up the sustainability of the model, especially the financial model (Simon’s diagram in the ted talk). 
The hybridity of social agency in museums in a way deposits for social sustainability. To my knowledge, ICA watershed functioned as a food distribution site during covid stress last year, a contemporary art museum (whose name I could not remember) became a space for covid vaccination. Simon explained several design nuances that welcome and inspire audience’s participation. I would like to add to the design elements, which is the building. This might align with the Lascaux’s discussion of architectural agency, a good number of museums are built in an intimidating and elitist way, I wonder if there would be possible retrofit or rehabilitation, permanent or ephemeral, transforming them into habitable space for civic engagement to ameliorate the situation.
