- Are there any exhibitions that you're currently planning on making changes to? If so, are there any specific reasons for doing so?
- When getting new photography pieces, do you typically alter the pieces in anyway or do you try to keep them in their original form as much as possible?
- How are photos chosen to be displayed in the museum versus archiving them?
- Are some photos originally in color but are changed to black and white?
