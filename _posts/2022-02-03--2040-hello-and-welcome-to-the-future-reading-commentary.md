The main takeaway from this article was that museums are evolving to support the needs of the community.
Museums are reinventing themselves into accessible educational spaces. The article mentioned that museums are predicted to evolve into places where people go to “work, learn, and teach each other”; As the cost of higher education is increasing, it is understandable that a place like this can be extremely valuable. However, it made me wonder how the role of the museum would be different from a library. The article even mentions that the role of a curator will be similar to a librarian. What would distinguish libraries from museums? or will they ultimately merge into one? What will be the core definition of a museum?
