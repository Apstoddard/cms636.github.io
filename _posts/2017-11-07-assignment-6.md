I failed in playing with omeka in the data processing part. When I try to import the CSV data, the website made me very confused with the untitled subjects. 
I tried to use Google open gallery then I realized it requires application and organization permission.
My original plan is to create a immersive experience for the visitor of the digital museum to understand the transformation of urban grid and landscape during the past centuries. So all the pictures I chose are mainly bird-eye view perspectives no matter it is photo or drawing. Through the storytelling, the visitor could see the function transformation of public space and the growing density of urban area. 
So I chose another website tool called pageflow to replace Google open gallery which I like most. Here are the examples:
