  - The Database
---

Has the digital age instilled a linear perspective into the way we tackle problems? If we think of the digital world as a collection of libraries, ultimately computerized items can we give life to such numberical representations. What I grew to question in this article is the emergence of databases? In the reading, the statement "The database is a cultural form of its own," stuck out to me. The opening spoke of the transition from the novel to film to all of a sudden a database. Isn't a database much broader, can't one encapsulate other forms of narration under a database. After all in its simplest form a database is an organized collection of related information, it is a work of curration. 

"Database Logic" is of great interest to me and the aesthetics that can be incorporated with it. I have trouble acknowledging that database and narrative are natural enemies. In the culture that they both reside, I believe that they can play off each other, rather than compete for the same role. It isn't very one sided to me to group narratives and other interactive forms under the database. Composition of narratives cannot be synthesized to just a database, there is a great human and personal element to narratives. Manovich then offers the narrative and database as competing imaginations, which I regard to be true. There is not a clear line between both, and I believe elements of both can bleed into each other, blurring the line between both. Has this blurring occurred from societies changed expectations of narratives, wanting something more and interactive?
