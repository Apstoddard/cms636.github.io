Has the digital age instilled a linear perspective into the way we tackle problems? If we think of the digital world as a collection of libraries, ultimately computerized items can we give life to such numberical representations? What I grew to question in this article is the emergence of databases? In the reading, the statement "The database is a cultural form of its own," stuck out to me. The opening spoke of the transition from the novel to film to all of a sudden a database. Isn't a database much broader, can't one encapsulate other forms of narration under a database. After all in its simplest form a database is an organized collection of related information, it is a work of curration. Hasn't our society revolved around organizing similar information together for great periods of time. This led me to search for the emergence and development of databases and I came across the following infographic that I found to be helpful.

"Database Logic" is of great interest to me and the aesthetics that can be incorporated with it.
