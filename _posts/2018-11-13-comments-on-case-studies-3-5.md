All the studies look at projects that aim to digitize and exhibit physical information (that is, objects, buildings, sites and other inherently non-abstract things) to a wide audience, while being careful to do so accurately an in accordance with the wishes of those originally associated with with what is to be exhibited. This is no small or easy task, and it is interesting how the different projects approach it differently, both using different tools and aiming for different platforms.

The projects, especially the "Augmented Objects & Spaces" and "Virtual Reconstruction of and Afghan Refugee Camp", face interesting dilemmas regarding how much to display of the available data, and how to do it in order to present a nuanced, factually correct view without disregarding subject privacy or sensationalizing the experience at the expense of the content.

As the case studies do not include any reports of how well the projects went, and the descriptions are fairly high-level, it is difficult to point out any appearent major flaws or strokes of genius. If done well, though, I believe they all have the potential to expand upon our knowledge in the relevant fields.
