## The Enemy VR Experience

After visiting The Enemy, I realized that the VR experience is not yet fully developed. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, but I think that the idea of VR exhibitions, or even AR exhibitions still have that sense of novelty, and it has not worn off yet.

**_Gallery One_** is described as a new way to view art with embedded technologies, like multi-touch screens, gamified interfaces, sensors, facial recognition, and augmented play. These new technologies and ways of interacting with art, seems to be a wonderful way to engage children into the world of art, as well as provide much more background and context to art for adults. Its goals seem to align really well with their execution, and their work is a really interesting case study for UI/UX designers. 

The article discusses the ways that Gallery One is truly a case of human-centered design, and a great application of design in revolutionizing our experiences. They have a really strong goal, with specific audiences, and adapt their experiences to each individual. They also help the audience understand by engaging their audience with questions that guide their experience. 

I feel like before visiting the exhibition at the MIT Museum, I felt like Gallery One could be the perfect museum exhibition. However, now that I am reflecting post-experience, I think there are probably some problems with Gallery One in real life. 

During the exhibition, all I could think about was the technology. I thought about a lot of separate things, including 1) rendering of people and textures, 2) rendering of sky and light (it dimmed when clouds passed), 3) eye tracking, and 4) the other people and the real life interaction. Because of all these-not distractions, but rather, interesting and new implementations of technology, all of which I would was excited to analyze- I felt like the message was lost in the medium. 

There were definitely a lot of **__Poetics__** with the addition of VR. It seemed to be much more humanizing, and the movements of the people were so much more engaging than I think typical audio- and video- art showcases.

Overall, I think this is just the very first great implementation of VR, and soon, it will be standard for everyone in the world. However, for now, it is still very eerie to see VR-zombies:
