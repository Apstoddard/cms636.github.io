### Case study 3:
There are a lot of interesting details to consider in this case study, especially in regard to the unstandardized documentation methods of all the religious artifacts. The amount of complexity involved in both collecting and validating the information is remarkable, especially with  the recordings of private religious practices. How do you preserve sanctity and respect for the culture while making it vulnerable and open to interpretation and observation?

### Case study 4:
I like that the case immediately talks about “the idea of using a virtual reconstruction…touches many nerves.” I thought the same thing right before reading the sentence. This case presents some unique challenges because it is deliberately not a display of collected artifacts, but instead a careful reconstruction of a site. Ultimately, its accuracy and impact is largely in the hands of the artists who interpret the information collected about the site— interviews, images, testimonies. I am particularly curious how they will integrate multimodal data into the experience and what they decide to prioritize in terms of the experience. 

### Case study 5:
The diversity of the types of manuscripts and written information in this case definitely lends itself well to the idea of a “multidimensional essay.” I often get frustrated whenever I read purely textual analyses of multimedia pieces and experiences— it feels like it’s “down sampling” in a sense. However, this project team handles these discrepancies very well, not only in their media and presentation of choice, but in their choice of team members and prioritizing complementary and diverse skillsets. I also particularly liked that the first point of the work plan is that the ENTIRE team works together to develop the information architecture— rather than immediately dividing work between siloed teams.
