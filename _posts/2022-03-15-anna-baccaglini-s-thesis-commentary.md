## Chapter 1

I think Anna highlights the tradeoff between engaging experiences and collections care in a good way. I think the approach of discursive displays are neat, and even the ideas from ASK Brooklyn seeem neat. However, I wanted to note that this doesn't mean all interaction is guaranteed to be enhancing for a visitor. I think before we obsess on the "distance" that we can close between visitor and exhibit, we should first assess what visitors want out of their visits (possibly even on a case-by-case basis). We've seen many methods of "engagement" employed which ultimately fail -- I'm curious to see why this might be so, and how that plays into the way we think about improving engagement of the visitor experience.


## Chapter 4

I think _Archeology of the Netherlands_ is a great example where an individual museum determined items in their exhibit that they were comfortable incorporating touch. In this case, they not only determined it was safe to do, but also knew the objective of their exhibit revolved around the awe/fascination in feeling pre-historic artifacts. Other exhibits might not rely on evoking such awe, and therefore might not need to force a touch exhibit implementation. I would love to know, however, whether the visitor experienc was truly enhanced by touching the artifacts. In many ways, I feel the awe from touch might just be the "novelty" of touching things that normally aren't allowed to be touched. If this becomes the norm in exhibits, will it really be as experience enhancing? I think we need to whittle down what it is about touch that enhances the exhibit for visitors. Interesting start!
