I feel that it is illuminating that part of the reimagination of a detoxed and decolonized museum is the audience. They challenged the “self-imposed limitations and policing of language for fear of offending an imagined, ‘traditional visitor’ who made up the ‘existing core audience’” and access the colonialist nature of museum experience through the projected audience. The decolonization of museum regarding curators and content envision a future of an ethnoracially and socially diverse group. 

Personally speaking, I was constraining the conversations we had prior to this reading concerning activities to the existing participants, and how to enhance their experience, the expansion of audience demography first came to me when reading this piece.
