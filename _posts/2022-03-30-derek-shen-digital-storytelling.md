I enjoyed this reading, as even in this class I feel we have approached the idea of effective narrative engagement/storytelling with lots of enthusiasm for technology. It is nice to hear from someone who has  been in the field, however, share the not so optimistic scenarios in which technology might not necessarily be the be-all" and end-all solution to audience engagement, especially when trying to tell a story. I enjoyed hearing the Strategic Thoughts section, and perhaps more specifically the "Have a Vision", "Use a little technology well, not a lot of technology poorly", and "Technology is a last resort". Very sobering reminders that some of our best stories as a species weren't necessarily ever anything special in regards to its media form/technology -- think of cave paintings by our ancestors or stories from family heirlooms. There are so many creative ways to output the same story, and while it's so easy to be swept up in the tide of ever-increasing technology, the best form of storytelling for an exhibit might just be to take a step back from it all and return to the basics that we're inherently familiar with.
