### Can we Actually Successfully Perform Sentiment Analysis off of Museum Visit Feedback?

I'm perhaps most fascinated by the avenues AI could be used for "under the hood of museum operations". In particular, I think performing sentiment analysis on museum visit feedback sounds amazing. I worry, however, with art often being so ambiguous and characterized in non-conventional vocabulary that doesn't inherently assume positive/negative sentiment, that it might be hard to train and test reliable models on certain exhibits. While some experiences are easily characterizable in positive/negative vocabulary (think customer service phone calls or restaurant reviews), I would be curious to see how a trained AI perceives the sentiment of certain words that might appear in visitor feedback, with some examples as follows: "lengthy", "quiet", "secluded", "structured", "familiar", "surprising", "puzzling", etc. Then again, it might just be a great tool to aggregate these frequent words and let the curator/museum staff decipher their sentiment in accordance to their museum's goals.
