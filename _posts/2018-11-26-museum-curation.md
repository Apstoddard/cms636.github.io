The articles describe how museums have shifted from having their focus on just objects towards the relevant societyâ€™s relationship towards to those objects. I believe that this should be the main focus of museums, they should strive to foster discussion and educate people. 

The second article talks about how many museums have had to integrate technology into their collections to make experiences more immersive to the public. This is probably true since we live in a society where even little kids have phones and when they go to a museum they can get easily tired of objects and text. I think it is important to use technology wherever appropriate to provide different experiences but museums should still keep in mind their main goals. Many museums take a different approach and overly use technology to make it more fun to the general public. Even though this is innovative, too many such distractions can make museum users lose focus on the stories the objects are trying to say, since they would have much of their attention on the technology itself.
