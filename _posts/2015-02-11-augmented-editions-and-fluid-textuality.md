It is quite amazing how digital environments allow us to access text in different languages. It would be unthinkable before the digital age to easily access different versions of texts. This change makes it easier for us to understand a piece of text since sometimes meanings can be lost in different translations or transcriptions. 

Fluid textuality makes "writing" a completely different experience. When I write, I often find myself in need of switching the orders of the paragraphs or sentences. Digital media makes this process infinitely easier than before. Also, it is very easy to figure out if I'm over-using a certain word with the ability to search throught the text in digital format. 

Digital environments are changing the way we making different editions of certain texts and also the way we create new writings.
