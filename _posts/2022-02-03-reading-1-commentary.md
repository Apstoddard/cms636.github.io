Both of these readings shifted how I framed museums. Growing up, I remember feeling like museums exhibits were sometimes out of reach and irrelevant. But my favorite museums have been ones that felt relatable and pertinent to things I was thinking about. I loved learning about local hidden history and how past issues connected to current issues. Adam Rozan touches on this concept in his adapted keynote address "Museums at 2040." I'm looking forward to museums as a physical (and virtual) house for community engagement and relevant learning. It can be hard to make the case to go to a physical location to learn when we can technically "learn" anything we want from our computer. But, by transforming museums into relevant community centers, museums can engage visitors and be catalysts for learning and connection.

I also liked how Nina Simon furthered these ideas in the preface to her book, "The Participatory Museum." She outlines 5 clear conecpts that instutions should keep in mind when designing their exhibits. All of them strike a common chord of reaching and connecting a wide array of people (instead of educated, old white people). This means museums should be dynamic and give patrons a space to participate in welcoming discussions and add to the musueums content as well.
