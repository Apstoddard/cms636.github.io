Automating Research Changes the Definition of Knowledge 
“How Google and the other harvesters of Big Data might change the meaning of learning”.  
	As an individual that has always been interested in a classic humanities education, I find the field of digital humanities and big data both exciting and frightening.  What knowledge do we as people lose from a field that is becoming increasingly digital? Can one even claim that there is any inherent loss in increased accessibility to data? I have always firmly believed that more knowledge is can only serve to enhance and individual and society, but if Big Data is changing the very meaning of knowledge, perhaps I am wrong.  There is obviously merit in analyzing data, and with an increased network amongst datasets it is easier than ever to find and study relationships and trends within data.  However, I am wary of a lack of context in which Big Data resides.  The Humanities are a study of the human condition, and this can be overlooked when dealing with large volumes of quantitative data.  In reassessing changing nature of learning, I must make and mindfully filter the information I digest. How do I differentiate patterns that are substantiated from the unsubstantiated? When the facts seem to be supported by Big Data, how does one support or refute that?
    
Limited Access to Big Data Creates New Digital Divides 
	Social inequality exists outside of social environments.  This fact is well known.  However, I was disturbed by the exclusivity surrounding access to social data, and by the creation of the “Big Data rich” and “Big Data poor” stratas.  While I am still defining my relationship with Big Data, one of its more alluring qualities is the fact that, hypothetically, it is universally accesible.  While numerous ethical questions surround the topic of Big Data, I find the questions surrounding accessibility to Big Data largely untapped and ethically fraught.  Companies that hold large amounts of social data have an obligation to make that information open to the public, especially if the public generates that data.  Money and status should not factor in to access to Big Data, and yet it does. If the web was created to share information, why have we begun to privatize data? I find this counter-intuitive to progress and morally problematic.
