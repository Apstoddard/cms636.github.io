- It seems like the List has mostly contemporary works -- to what extent do you usually collaborate with the artists? How different does it feel from more traditional art museums with larger, older collections? I noticed, for instance, you all are able to have the artists come and give talks

- Do you get a lot of visitors from the broader community or is it mostly MIT folks? What's it like to be an art museum at a technically focused institution?

- How do you think about exhibiting unusual artifacts, like Matthew Angelo Harrison's 3D printers? Do you often get the opportunity to display the technology that's part of an artistic process?
