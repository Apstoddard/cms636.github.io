Hello! I'm Hiya, a rising Junior at Wellesley studing Media Arts and Sciences and minoring in Economics. I'm an aspiring UX designer, in my free time I love to travel, eat/cook and visit museums. I'm really excited to build projects this semester. Having studied in a liberal arts school for the past two years, I'm intrigued by the synthesis of different fields and their evolving nature over time.
