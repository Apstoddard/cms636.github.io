- What is the process in preparing to represent an artist's work as a curator? How is information passed from artist to curator?
- What is the place of a curator in interpreting if multiple artists' match the narrative of the exhibit they're trying to build?
- What is something unexpected that takes a lot of effort as a curator before opening day?
- Where do you begin in ideating for themes of new exhibitions? Do you stay within a similar theme, or is it less systematic than that?
- Similar to above, do you specialize in certain mediums? Or do you explore mediums on the basis of what you want to convey in your exhibition?
- I imagine you learn many things as you curate more exhibits/work alongside different artists? What are some things you've learned in light of your most recent exhibit?
- We've learned of a couple examples where working with interdisciplinary teams has been a great idea on paper, but not as great in actuality. Is there a party/stakeholder that's particularly difficult to work with or integrate into your process?
