title: 'Project Idea: Removed Monuments Garden'
author: Anna Ivanov
---
Based on the idea of Muzeon’s [Fallen Monuments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_Monument_Park) Park in Moscow, I’d like to create a virtual statue garden of Boston. In this garden would be statues that people have wanted to take down, such as statues of Columbus. They’d be somehow accompanied by information- who is portrayed, why people want to remove it, and where it currently is located, for example. I think having all them together would demonstrate a lot about Boston’s history, while also showing that it is possible to acknowledge history without celebrating figures with monuments in prominent locations. In this way, it would be of interest to people with differing opinions on whether monuments should be removed in the first place. I also talked to people in class some about what it would like to then reimagine the original spaces without the monuments there. Obviously, this is an idea in progress, and I'm happy to do other things as well, but this one is something I've been thinking about!
