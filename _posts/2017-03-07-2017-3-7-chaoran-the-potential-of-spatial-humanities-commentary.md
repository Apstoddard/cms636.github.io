> Spaces are not simply the setting for historical action but are a significant product and determinant of change. 'Ihey are not passive settings but the medium for the development of culture.

> All spaces contain embedded stories based on what has happened there. These stories are both individual and collective, and each of them link geography (space) and history (time). More important, they all reflect the values and cultural codes present in the various political and social arrangements that provide structure to society.

> There is nothing new in this development-power arrangements can be seen even in the earliest maps-but humanities scholarship increasingly reflects what may in fact by the greatest legacy of postmodernism, the acknowledgement that our understanding of the world itself is socially constructed.

> First, the world could not be measured so precisely as positivism assumed. Knowledge was always contingent upon the perspective of the observer. Even calculations of the laterial world depended upon cultural assumptions; not every society accepted or used the precepts of Euclidian geometry. But GIS privileged quantitative data, Which it required to be precise. It did not accept uncertain fuzziness. It also favored official representations of the world, a fesult that was highly problematic because this view reflected the influence of money and power. For purposes of economic development, for instance, local government could draw neighborhood boundaries that bore little resemblance to the community identified by residents. Finally,
its use of geometric space and Boolean logic ruled out the possibility of alternate, non-Western views of the world. 


> In its epistemology, history is not a grand narrative-an authoritative story of a society's past-but instead a fragmented, provisional, contingent understanding framed by multiple voices and multiple stories, mini-narratives of small events and practices, each conditioned by the unique experiences and local cultures that gave rise to them.
