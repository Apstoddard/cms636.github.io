In Christina Kreps’ article, she analyzed the concept of “Cash Cash” which illustrates the social and cultural characteristic of curating and museum. This character also brings out the debating balance between objects and people in the defining the museums. I think the way she tried to help readers understand the forming and changing of curators’ responsibilities is clear. And the extended explanation of curator seems fresh and inspiring: “If we return to this original meaning of a curator as a caretaker, then we can see how individuals or classes of people—such as priests, shamans, spiritual leaders, or royal functionaries—also have been curators. These people can possess specialized knowledge about certain kinds of objects and their care.” Because of the public character and education purpose for museums today, the uniqueness of appreciating objects in other small groups becomes attractive. 

In Jana’s article, the main topic here is to define the difference between users(active) and visitors(welcome). Also, she took the new generation of museum users who use technology for self-directed information-gathering and cultural consumption as an example to illustrate how should we design a new museum experience. Obviously, she is more people-focus oriented and wanted to build different cultural environments for different users in the museum, while she also welcomed the debates in this public space. 

I personally find that both approaches are acceptable and reasonable because under such a discovery period. Isabella Stewart Gardner museum is a good example for combing different approach. In the old part, it keeps the art pieces in the relevant settings and decorations to protect the historical aura. In the new part where Renzo Piano carefully designed, the museum uses some advanced technologies to help the visitors get more background information about its exhibitions. And the setting of the exhibition is different from the old part which gives the visitors diversified experience.
